The following rules must be observed when using these interfaces:\nAbsolute path names must be provided. For destination filenames, the permissions of the path (or existing file) must be set: Write permissions for all. Write permissions for common group: in this case, user zymbit must be added to the group that has permissions for the destination directory path and/or existing file. Destination path must be fully owned by user and/or group zymbit. Similar rules exist for source filenames: Read permissions for all. Read permissions for common group: in this case, user zymbit must be added to the group that has permissions for the source directory path and/or existing file. Source path must be fully owned by user and/or group zymbit. Crypto Features Random Number Generation This feature is useful when the default host random number generator is suspected of having cryptographic weakness. It can also be used to supplement existing random number generation sources. Zymkey bases its random number generation on an internal TRNG (True Random Number Generator) and performs well under Fourmilab’s ent.\nData Locker Zymkey includes a feature, called Data Locking. This feature is essentially an AES encryption of the data block followed by an ECDSA signature trailer.\nData Locker Keys In addition to a unique ECDSA private/public key pair, each Zymkey has two unique AES keys that are programmed at the factory.\nECDSA Operations Each Zymkey comes out of the factory with three (Zymkey 4i/HSM4) or 12 (HSM6) unique ECDSA private/public key pairs. These private keys are randomly programmed within hardware at the time of manufacture and never exported. In fact, Zymbit doesn’t even know what the value of the private keys are.\nThere are three ECDSA operations available:\nGenerate signature: The Zymkey is capable of generating an ECDSA signature. Verification signature: The Zymkey is capable of verifying an ECDSA signature. Export the ECDSA public key: This saves the public key to a file in PEM format. This operation is useful for generating a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). Other Features LED The Zymkey has an LED which can be turned on, off or flashed at an interval.\ni2c Address For Zymkeys with an i2c interface, the base address can be changed to work around addressing conflicts. The default address is 0x30, but can be changed in the ranges 0x30 - 0x37 and 0x60 - 0x67.\nTap Sensitivity The Zymkey has an accelerometer which can perform tap detection. The sensitivity of the tap detection is configurable.\nProgramming Language Support Currently, C, C++ and Python are supported.\nBinding Before a Zymkey can be effectively used on a host computer, it must be “bound” to it. Binding is a process where a “fingerprint” is made which is composed of the host computer and its SD card serial numbers as well as the Zymkey serial number. If the host computer or SD card is changed from the time of binding, the Zymkey will refuse to accept commands.\nTo learn more about binding your zymkey, see Binding, Device ID, and Authentication\nHSM4 Soft Bind Lock Unlike Zymkey, HSM4 does not have a physical lock tab that is cut to lock the host binding. Instead, it has a software API for locking the binding to the host. See the soft bind lock API description for more information.\nHSM6 Soft Bind Lock See “HSM4: Soft Bind Lock” above.\nECDH ECDH with some Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) is available. The available KDFs include:\nnone: The raw pre-master secret is returned. rfc5869: This KDF can be invoked with SHA256 or SHA512 as the hashing function. pbkdf2: Like rfc5869, SHA256 or SHA512 can be specified. Koblitz Curve Support In addition to NIST P-256 which is available on Zymkey and HSM4, the Koblitz 256 bit curve is available as well.\nMore Key Slots HSM6 now has 12 factory pre-configured NIST P-256 key slots and 512 key pairs for generated key pair and digital wallet allocation for NIST P-256 or Koblitz 256. All of these key slots can be used for ECDSA as well as ECDH operations. It is also possible to remove the keys in the 512 key pair store and also prohibit public key export.\nForeign Public Keyring 128 public key slots are available to form a public key store for storing foreign party public keys. Like the 512 key pair store, public keys can be removed and prohibited from export.\nDigital Wallet HSM6 provides APIs which allow the creation of 1 or more digital wallets per BIP 32/39/44. The number of master seeds and child nodes is only limited by the number of key pairs provided for in the 512 byte key pair store. The BIP 39 feature provides the mnemonic sentence using the 2048 word English dictionary.\nBattery and Temperature Monitoring The HSM6 has APIs for reading the battery voltage as well as monitoring policies for taking action if certain thresholds are exceeded.\nBattery Monitoring The Battery Monitoring feature provides for 1 of 2 actions if the battery voltage below specified threshold (settable from 2.5V or lower via API).\nself-destruct:\nIf the battery voltage goes lower than the threshold, destroy all key material. Good for use cases where a low battery voltage is interpreted as an attempt to attack the low power tamper detect operation. sleep-until-battery-recovery:\nDo not permit full functionality until the battery has gone above the threshold. Good for use cases where battery replacement is desirable. Temperature Monitoring The Temperature Monitoring feature provides protection from attacks that are based on manipulation of temperature (e.g. memory freeze attacks). If invoked, the system may be configured to destroy keys if temperature thresholds are exceeded.\n","categories":"","description":"Intro to Zymkey Application Utilities","excerpt":"Intro to Zymkey Application Utilities","ref":"/api/api_docs_intro/","tags":"","title":"Intro to Zymkey Application Utilities"},{"body":"Scope This section explains the perimeter detect feature on Zymkey4 and how to use it in your software application with a simple two wire loop physical configuration.\nFor alternative physical configurations and best practices: Learn more \u003e\nPerimeter Detect provides two additional layers of physical security that can be used to detect when the perimeter of your device is breached. This is an important feature when devices are deployed in the field, unattended or in high risk environments.\nZymkey4 includes two independent Perimeter Loops that can be configured to meet different applications.\nWhen a Perimeter Loop is breached, Zymkey4 can be configured (at time of binding) to respond with different “Actions”, depending upon your security policy.\nConnecting Perimeter Loop Circuits Zymkey4 uses a standard microUSB connector to interface to perimeter circuits 1 and 2. This is convenient for rapid prototyping and small scale production situations.\n(For high volume applications, different connector types are available. Contact Zymbit for more details.)\nUsing a Standard USB EXTENSION Cable for Perimeter Loop You can use a micro-usb EXTENSION cable, which carries all necessary signals, to connect to the perimeter detect. Here is one example of an extension cable that will work. (Remove the female connector to expose the flying leads as shown below, then connect your perimeter circuits - P1, P2 - to these)\nIMPORTANT: do NOT use standard micro-usb charging cable it will not work, because it does not have a wire on pin 4.\nElectrical Circuit Each perimeter loop should be connected with a 30 AWG wire or thicker and nominal length of 2 feet. For longer lengths contact Zymbit. The wire should be electrically insulated for all applications. A shielded cable may be necessary for electrically noisy or industrial applications.\nCustom flex PCBs and rigid PCBs may also be used to complete a perimeter loop circuit.\nPerimeter Breach Response Actions Prior to permanently binding your Zymkey to a specific host device, it can be configured through the API to respond to a perimeter breach event in one of three ways. After permanent binding is completed, the selected configuration is locked and immutable.\nResponse Choices A) Do nothing (disable) B) Notify host when perimeter breach occurs C) Destroy all key material (this essentially destroys any encrypted data or file system)\nRefer to API documentation for more details.\nTest Perimeter Detect Developer Mode only\nTo quickly test your perimeter detect setup, here are two samples of code using the Python and C API’s. Both programs will wait for one second to detect any perimeter breaches.\nPlease specify the channel (0 or 1) you are testing in either set_perimeter_event_actions or zkSetPerimeterEventAction.

It connects to the GPIO header of the SBC and uses the I2C bus and GPIO4 as a WAKE_PIN to communicate with the SBC CPU via an encrypted channel.\nIn this Getting Started guide we describe how to install your ZYMKEY4 to a Raspberry Pi running Raspberry PI OS or Ubuntu. The installation process is the same for both of these Linux distributions.\nThe ZYMKEY4 occupies 10 pins on the GPIO header. It can also be used with other GPIO devices attached, or other I2C devices attached. The correct address range and use of IO pins will be described in this guide as well.\nZYMKEY4 Hardware The top and bottom of the ZYMKEY4 hardware showing the location of the GPIO header and other connectors.\nZYMKEY4 Pinout The pinout of the header of the ZYMKEY4. ZYMKEY4 requires exclusive access to GPIO4, which can be remapped to another GPIO pin. It also share the I2C bus with the default address of 0x30.\nSummary of Setup Steps Installing the hardware Install the battery on the ZYMKEY4, and connect it to the host single-board computer (SBC). Establish an I2C connection Enable the I2C bus on the host device in order to be able to communicate with the ZYMKEY4. Install the Zymbit Driver Package These utilities provided by Zymbit are necessary to interact with the hardware module. Test the installation Your ZYMKEY4 is now temporarily bound to your SBC and ready for use in developer mode. Installing the hardware Battery Installation Warning Battery installation is not required for the ZYMKEY4 to function, but it is highly recommended if your device is vulnerable to physical access! To maintain the real-time clock (RTC) and tamper detection features in the event of power loss, install a high quality 3V CR1025 coincell battery (not included) in the ZYMKEY4’s battery slot with +ve facing upward. Recommend CR1025 from Panasonic or Renata\nHardware Installation Danger Installing your hardware correctly is important to avoid destroying your SBC or ZYMKEY4. Be sure to follow the instructions below carefully. In particular:\nPay close attention to the images below to ensure the SBC’s GPIO pins are properly aligned with the ZYMKEY4’s header. Ensure that your Raspberry Pi is powered down before proceeding. Ensure that the coincell battery (if installed) is installed with the positive side (marked with +) facing upward. Before installing Power off your Raspberry Pi to ensure that neither the SBC or the ZYMKEY4 are damaged.\nAttach hardware Hold the ZYMKEY4 with the LED and battery holder facing upward. Then, carefully align the ZYMKEY4’s connector with the first 10 GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi.\nPress down firmly on the ZYMKEY4 to connect it to the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi. The ZYMKEY4 should fit relatively snug and maintain a tight interference fit around the pins.\nThe ZYMKEY4 occupies 10 pins on the GPIO header. If the header of the ZYMKEY4 isn’t properly aligned with the GPIO header of the Raspberry Pi, both devices could be damaged.\nResources Using an Alternative GPIO Pin The default configuration uses GPIO4. This can be reconfigured to use another GPIO of your choice. View resource Power on and confirm operation After you have connected the hardware and are sure that the pins are properly aligned, power up your Raspberry Pi. You should see a blue LED blinking rapidly and consistently (5 blinks per second). This confirms that your ZYMKEY4 is operation but unconfigured.\nIf the blue LED blinks erractically, or not at all, then there is an installation error and you should check the connections.\nResources Power Quality Considerations Power quality matters to the reliable and secure operation of your system and ZYMKEY4. View resource Establish an I2C connection For Raspian-based operating systems, you must configure the state of the I2C.\nLog in to your Raspberry Pi and run sudo raspi-config. Navigate to Interfacing Options -\u003e I2C -\u003e Would you like the ARM I2C interface to be enabled? Select yes, and confirm this choice. Your I2C bus is now configured and ready to talk to the ZYMKEY4. The default I2C address for the ZYMKEY4 is 0x30. NOTE: The ZYMKEY4 will not show up in the display of tools such as i2cdetect. This is by design.\nResources ZYMKEY4 FAQ \u0026 Troubleshooting How do I set an alternative I2C address? The default I2C address for ZYMKEY4 is 0x30. If this conflicts with another device in your system, you can reconfigure the ZYMKEY4 to use another address of your choice. View resource Install the Zymbit Driver Package Login to your host device and follow these steps to install the ZYMKEY4’s Zymbit Driver Package.\nThe ZYMKEY4 will require a number of packages to be installed from the Raspbian and Zymbit apt repositories. The following setup script will be install a number of files and software packages on your system, including:\nZymbit .service files located in the /etc/systemd/system directory pip Ensure that curl is installed on your host:\nsudo apt install curl Download and install the necessary Zymbit services onto your device.\ncurl -G https://s3.amazonaws.com/zk-sw-repo/install_zk_sw.sh | sudo bash Test the installation When the software installation has completed, reboot your device. After the reboot has completed, the Raspberry Pi will perform an operation that will temporarily bind the ZYMKEY4 to your SBC. Once the ZYMKEY4 is bound to the SBC, the ZYMKEY4’s blue LED should blink slowly–once every 3 seconds–to indicate that the binding is complete.\nResources Binding, Device ID, and Authentication In production mode, ZYMKEY4 generates a unique Device ID by measuring certain attributes of the specific host and the ZYMKEY4 itself to permanently associate the two. View resource The quickest way to get started is to see the ZYMKEY4’s various features at work by running some example test scripts.\nRun the scripts:\npython3 /usr/local/share/zymkey/examples/zk_app_utils_test.py python3 /usr/local/share/zymkey/examples/zk_crypto_test.py Now you’re ready to start developing with ZYMKEY4 and Raspberry Pi. When it’s time to deploy your project, read our guide on enabling Production Mode:\nResources Enabling Production Mode - ZYMKEY4 To permanently bind the ZYMKEY4 to a host board, generates a unique Device ID by measuring certain attributes of the host and the ZYMKEY4 itself to associate the two devices.

Bootware supports various Raspberry Pi computers and requires a Zymbit HSM or SCM to run. Bootware takes advantage of security features of various Zymbit products and protects credentials via the HSM.\nA free ZYMKEY is available when you sign up for a Bootware trial. See Get Bootware\nIf you want to jump right in, Click here to Get Started! What is Bootware? Bootware is a full-featured native OS switcher/manager with first rate support for encrypted root and data partitions. Bootware is not a hypervisor.\nBootware supports both manual and automatic rollback between A and B installations. If rollback fails, Bootware is able to enter recovery to reload one of the installations from either a local image or a remote secure endpoint.\nBootware works with 64-bit versions of Raspberry Pi OS and Ubuntu on Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 and the various compute module variants.\nBootware is not an OS, therefore custom OS builds are generally supported. For larger orders, Zymbit is able to offer device programming and image validation services of custom user OS builds.\nBootware is not an IoT cloud stack, and interoperates well with most popular stacks. Bootware manages the relationship between bare metal and OS installations as simply, securely, and robustly as possible.\nBootware correctly handles potentially conflicting sets of kernels and boot artifacts, allowing for major kernel upgrades to occur without undue distress.\nBootware fully isolates bootable root partitions with separate sets of LUKS credentials, which are securely injected into user s OS initramfs images. Bootware supports a shared data partition, for which the credentials are distributed to new installations. Each new installation gets a clean new set of keys and one root partition cannot access the other.\nNew installations are deployed from within Bootware’s secure enclave, zboot, which boots straight via secure boot. zboot is able to download, validate, and deploy updates without relying on a potentially compromised OS installation to install the next new clean image.\nBootware has a robust workflow for update signing, which may use either hardware or software key options. Update signing occurs on a dedicated publishing node.\nBootware uses full image forklift updates for major OS installations. Partial overlay updates are also supported, and may be installed directly from user mode.\nBootware runs of top of Zymbit’s security services package, which is required to use Zymbit security hardware.\nBootware has additional integrations with Zymbit Secure Edge Nodes, which may be purchased to development and production use, or may be used as reference designs for custom hardware. For highly secure products, such as Secure Compute Modules, Bootware is almost essential in order to apply updates without the ability to use Pi burner tools, which are intentionally disabled.\nBootware installation locations: Bootware secure uboot and the secure enclave, zboot, along with encrypted configurations files are installed in into /boot.\nBootware uses Zymbit LUKS initramfs unlock code already present in standard Zymbit driver package, but will inject credentials before encrypting the initramfs together with the kernel and boot artifacts into an immutable boot image for secure uboot.\nBootware installs zbcli and Bootware scripts into user OS. User must ensure that these packages are present in user images to be deployed using Bootware. User mode tools manage Bootware settings and check for updates on USB drives or on remote endpoints. zbcli also allows user to trigger manual rollback and update installations. Once a suitable update is located, Bootware reboots into zboot to install.\nBootware boot sequence: For Zymbit Secure Compute Modules only, supervisor-based pre-boot environment validates and repairs /boot partition. Zymkey and HSM products do not have this feature.\nPi ROM code boots and loads standard Pi artifacts.\nZymbit uboot loads\nIf user boot is to proceed normally:\nUboot loads, decrypts, and validates boot package for the active boot partition. The package includes everything required to boot that installation inclusive of kernel, initramfs, args, device tree objects, etc.\nBoot counter is incremented and control is passed to the kernel.\nOnce in initramfs, zbunlock is invoked to connect to the HSM and to decrypt LUKS credentials that have been previously injected into initramfs. /root is mounted.\nOnce boot is complete, boot counter is reset. If the boot fails, and the system reboots for whichever reason, the process repeats with boot counter incrementing.\nIf the boot counter has exceeded the threshold, rollback occurs:\nUboot loads zboot to switch to the backup partition\nSystem reboots\nUboot attempts to boot the backup boot partition in the same way it boots the active partition.\nOnce boot is complete, boot counter is reset. If the boot fails, and the system reboots for whichever reason, the process repeats with boot counter incrementing.\nIf the boot counter for the backup partition also exceeds the threshold without a successful boot, the system enters recovery mode:\nUboot loads zboot.\nZboot attempts to locate an image to install either on a local USB drive or on a known remote endpoint.\nIf the image is found, it is installed, and then the system is rebooted into it. All images are checked for correct signatures before applying them to the system.\nIf the image is not found, zboot enters console interactive mode and asks for endpoint information. Any image to be installed must have a proper signature.\nBootware is designed with the singular goal to ensure that properly validated and installed image is booted successfully on user’s machine.\nAdditional Resources Register for Bootware Technical Updates\nMore information on Bootware on zymbit.com\nBootware Community\nLinks to Bootware Documentation Sections ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Bootware is a secure, integrated tool for managing multiple Linux OS …","ref":"/bootware1.3.2/","tags":"","title":"Welcome to Bootware"},{"body":"Altium Zymbit HSM Library-Altium (728 KB)\nKiCAD (Version 6 only) Zymbit HSM6 Library-KiCAD 6 (221 KB)\n3D Step Model HSM6 Can Assembly REV D 1.1.4.STEP (1.3 MB)\nCAD Graphic Summary ","categories":"","description":"Altium, KiCAD, and 3D Step Model files for the HSM6","excerpt":"Altium, KiCAD, and 3D Step Model files for the HSM6","ref":"/reference/cad/hsm6/","tags":"","title":"HSM6 CAD Files"},{"body":"EU Declaration of Conformity\nFCC Declaration of Conformity\nRoHS/Reach Declaration of Conformity\nCalifornia Prop 65 Declaration of Conformity\nLetter of Volatility Zymkey4i, HSM4, HSM6\n","categories":"","description":"HSM6 Conformity Documents","excerpt":"HSM6 Conformity Documents","ref":"/reference/conformity/hsm6/","tags":"","title":"HSM6 Conformity Documents"},{"body":" Introduction The SEN 500 provides all the hardware and software components required to get started implementing your secure application. Inside the SEN 500, includes a Raspberry PI CM5 along with the Zymbit Motherboard detailed below, as well as a Zymbit Interposer-based HSM.\nConfigure and Setup your SEN 500 Zymbit SEN 500 I/O ports Power On Connect the optional 24V/12V Power Supply up to the front panel barrel connector. Connect an Cat5e/Cat6 ethernet cable to the gigabit ethernet port. The unit is designed to run either headless via SSH, or, if you prefer, attach a monitor to one of the HDMI ports and a keyboard and mouse to the USB ports and login via the console.\nMonitor the top LED (SEC) for the status of the Zymbit module. It will go through the following stages:\nrapid blue blinking: Booting underway one blue blink every 3 seconds: zkifc has loaded and the system is ready to go Once the boot sequence completes and the top LED (SEC) is blinking blue once every three seconds, login either via the console or remotely via SSH. As shipped, the hostname is zymbit-dev and a user named zymbit can be used for login. The default password is zymbit. Please change your password once you login.\nThat is all it takes to get up and running!\nAccessing the inside of the SEN 500 To gain access to the SEN 500, power down and remove the six torx screws. Carefully remove the lid. It does not void any warranty to open the unit in order to install Pi HATs, sensors, M.2 hardware, configure as a MSD/rpiboot, or arrange tamper prevention. If needed, remove the four nylon screws to separate the CM5 from the Zymbit HSM. Reverse the process to reassemble and close the unit.\nOverview of the features of the SEN 500 - Zymbit Motherboard Zymbit SEN 500 Motherboard - Top Zymbit SEN 500 Motherboard- Bottom Features Status LED Indicators LED Designator LED Designator\nLightpipe (Top) Lightpipe (Bottom)\nSEN 500 Enclosure Designator Lightpipe Order Purpose Legend Type Off Green or Blue Red Yellow or purple LED2 Top Security SEC Blue/Red Not Secure Blinking Zymbit Blue LED Critical security fault Purple Noncritical Security fault/incident LED3 3 Activity ACT Green/Red No Activity eMMC or PCIE activity Pi power error Pi Power error but still operational LED10 2 Primary power PWR Green/Red No primary power Full primary power Primary power error Sleep/low power LED11 Bottom Secondary power PWR2 Green/Red No secondary power Full secondary power Secondary power error Secondary power is limited Security LED The security LED is Zymbit HSM status LED. This will normally blink a blue pattern to give its status (see SCM LED Reference for details).\nIf the LED is illuminated red, that indicates a critical security fault and the system is not operational anymore. If the LED is illuminated purple or blinking red-purple, this indicates a noncritical security fault/incident, and the system is still operational.\nActivity LED The activity green LED has several purposes. It replicates the green LED on the Raspberry Pi CM5 (signifying eMMC access, or signifying error during boot with a flash code), and it indicates activity on an M.2 drive if one is in use.\nIf it is red, this indicates the Pi power status. If the light is OFF, it indicates that the device is getting enough power and should be performing correctly. If it is blinking, the red light indicates the Pi is not being supplied enough power. If the red light is continuously on, this means there is inadequate power, and the Pi is keeping itself off to prevent damage.\nPrimary Power LED This LED indicates the primary system power status. If it is off, it indicates no power; green indicates full primary power, and red indicates primary power error. A primary power error can occur if the eFuse on the primary power supply has a fault or if the onboard primary power supply is disabled by the Zymbit SCM.\nA yellow indication means low power or sleep mode (not yet supported).\nSecondary Power LED This LED indicates the secondary power status if one is present. If this LED is off, it indicates that no secondary power is available. If it is green, it indicates full secondary power. If it indicates red there is a secondary power error (or it is not being used), and yellow indicates limited secondary power.\nExamples of limited or error secondary power indications could include a PoE injector that is not a valid PD class for full power, or any power at all.\nPower System The Zymbit Motherboard contains a PSU with multiple key features, such as a wide input voltage range, various forms of input protection, onboard voltage/current monitoring, and redundant power supply capabilities. These features and different power subsystems are described below.\nInput Power Input range (absolute maximums): +9V-30V; above or below these values eFuse protection cuts power to the system Input range (recommended): +12V-24V Input barrel jack connector J21 (2.0 x 6.0 mm) or through auxiliary bard connector J24 Input Power Protection There are two stages of input power protection on the Zymbit Motherboard. The first is ESD, EMI, and reverse current protection to safeguard against dangerous voltage spikes. The second is an eFuse used to limit the input voltage to a specified range.\nThe eFuse protection stage uses the TI LM5060 designed to limit the input power range to +9V-30V. Above 30V, the over-voltage protection lockout occurs, and the system has to be reset in order to turn on. Under +9V, the under-voltage lockout protection is triggered to protect the system from “brownout” and possible low-power attacks. The system should recover automatically once power is restored to above the undervoltage lockout (UVLO) threshold. The eFuse has an active low ‘power good’ indicator that can be monitored by the system.\nSubsystem Power The Zymbit Motherboard has three different power supplies on board to serve different subsystems.\nThe first power supply provides 5V, 5A to the system. This supply is what powers the host device (SCM, CM4, etc.), GPIOs, and auxiliary devices.\nThe second power supply is a 3.3V, 5A supply designed specifically to power devices plugged into the PCIe M.2 slot (like NVMe drives). This is to ensure that potentially power-intensive devices do not affect the main system power.\nThe third subsystem supply is a 3.3V, 300mA LDO designed as a standby voltage supply for key subsystems such as status LEDs and standby voltage for SCM security features.\nVoltage/Current Monitoring The Zymbit Motherboard can monitor several system voltage/current values using current sense monitors via ADCs that are accessible via I2C from the host device. (These are approximate readings and are subject to noise and error, both designed and unintended)\nThe ADCs are accessible via the I2C bus 0 and have addresses 100 1000 (72) and 100 1001 (73).\nThe values that are monitored are as follows:\nADC0 (status monitor) addr: 72 Channel 0: VEXT_MON (external voltage monitor) Channel 1: eFuse nPOWER_GOOD voltage Channel 2: Ambient temperature Channel 3: POE_PSTAT voltage ADC1 (power monitor) addr: 73 Channel 0: System input voltage (+VIN) Channel 1: System current Channel 2: Current draw on 5V supply Channel 3: Current draw on 3.3V M.2 supply Note: ambient temperature sensor readings:\nThe ambient temperature sensor (TMP235A4DCKR) is designed to read the ambient temperature inside the SEN enclosure. However readings may seem higher than expected if not using the device for more intensive operation because it is picking up the heat from the physical PCB. This levels out over time and should be fairly accurate to the internal temperature after stabilization.\nNote: POE_PSTAT voltage:\nThe POE_PSTAT voltage is a combination of two POE status lines. See the table below for reference (Measured voltages might differ but general buckets are accurate):\nP1 P2 POE_PSTAT (V) 1 1 3.26 1 0 1.31 0 1 2.61 0 0 0.65 Reading from ADCs Example:\nNOTE for CM5: you have to specifically enable I2C0 in /boot/firmware/config.txt\ndtparam=i2c_csi_dsi0=on Example python program to read values: #!/usr/bin/env python import logging import sys import busio from adafruit_tla202x import TLA2024 from adafruit_extended_bus import ExtendedI2C import time import os logging.basicConfig( level=logging.INFO, format=\"%(asctime)s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s\", datefmt=\"%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S\", ) def get_raspberry_pi_model() -\u003e str: \"\"\" Get the raspberry pi model so that we can set the I2C bus appropriately Returns: The model string from /proc/cpuinfo \"\"\" try: with open(\"/proc/cpuinfo\", \"r\") as f: for line in f: if \"model\" in line.lower(): revision = line.split(\":\")[-1].strip() return f\"Model: {revision}\" except FileNotFoundError: return \"Not running on a Raspberry Pi.\" return \"Unable to determine the model.\" # Initialize the TLA2024 ADC def initialize_adc() -\u003e list[TLA2024, TLA2024]: \"\"\" Initialize the I2C bus and the ADC objects Returns: The ADC objects \"\"\" try: model = get_raspberry_pi_model() if \"5\" in model: i2c = ExtendedI2C(10) else: i2c = busio.I2C(45, 44) tla = TLA2024(i2c, 72) # STATUS LINES ADC tla2 = TLA2024(i2c, 73) # PWR ADC except ValueError as e: logging.error(\"FAILED\") logging.error(e) sys.exit(1) except Exception as e: logging.error(\"FAILED\") logging.error(f\"Unexpected error: {e}\") sys.exit(1) return [tla, tla2] def calc_vin(vout: float) -\u003e float: \"\"\" Calculate the voltage to the input of the voltage divider going into channel 0 of the ADC Args: vout (float): The voltage read in by the ADC which is the output of the voltage divider on channel 0 Returns: The input voltage to the voltage divider which is the designated signal to be monitored \"\"\" r1 = 510000 r2 = 41200 # voltage divider equatio n # vout = (r2 / (r1 + r2)) * vin vin = vout / (r2 / (r1 + r2)) return vin def calc_current(vout: float) -\u003e float: \"\"\" Calculate the current given the output voltage of the current sense monitors.

This mirrors the functionality of the Pi5 power button but will also have additional security functionality. For CM5 based devices, currently it will power down and put the device to sleep but does not turn the unit back on.\nGeneral IO USB (J18 \u0026 J19) TO ENABLE EXTERNAL USB: POSITION 3 OF SW1 MUST BE CLOSED (DEFAULT IS ENABLED).\nIf SW1 if off, both USB power to the external USB connectors will be cut and the data lines will be disconnected. Externally powered USB devices can’t be forced to connect.\nEnable external USB: Position 3 of SW1 closed The Zymbit Motherboard has a total of three USB ports available. Two ports are externally exposed via a dual stack USB connector (J18), and there is one internal ‘AUX USB’ exposed through a 5-pin connector (J19). Each USB port has its own current limiting switch set to 1.2A.\nThe following table summarizes the configurations.\nUSB Port\\Configuration CM5 Top Port USB3, shared EN, OC Bottom Port USB3, shared EN, OC Auxiliary Port (internal) USB2, no EN or OC When using a CM5 as the host platform, USB3 is used and enabled by default with a weak pullup to signal that the USB3 ports should be powered. If you would like to have the CM5 control USB3 enable, close position 2 on SW1.\nEnable CM5 control of USB3 Dual Mini HDMI 2.0 Connectors (J25 \u0026 J26) The host device (CM5) does most of the interfacing required for the HDMI interface so that most signals are directly connected to the host. HDMI connectors require a +5V supply, which is provided on the Zymbit Motherboard via current-limited switches.\nThere is also added ESD protection for each port.\nGigabit Ethernet RJ45 (J6) The Zymbit Motherboard uses a standard 1:1 Ethernet MagJack, which supports PoE as well. Additional ESD protection is provided on the Zymbit Motherboard, as it is typically needed in PoE applications. The PoE signals from the RJ45 connector are connected to J9. To use PoE, a separate Zymbit PoE expansion board is required.\nM.2 Type M Connector (J12) The M.2 connector is an M key slot that connects to the PCIe bus of the host. It has a dedicated 15W (3.3V, 5A) power supply. This is to support PCIe-enabled devices like NVMe drives. 1x PCIe bus is routed from the computer module slot. The speed of the bus depends on the compute module used.\nCamera/DSI Display Connector (J11) J11 is a bidirectional MIPI interface that can be used as a camera or display.\nCamera/DSI Display Connector (J13) J13 is a bidirectional MIPI interface that can be used as a camera or display. To enable this functionality, please refer to the Raspberry Pi documentation for enabling the correct overlay for I2C0 to be used. The CM5 expects I2C1 to be used as this is a change from the CM4 to CM5 IO board.\nFan Header (J5) J5 is a header for a standard 5V PWM fan. This part is not populated on standard products but is meant to use Molex 47054-1000 or similar as the mating connector.\nRaspberry Pi HAT Connector (40 Pin Connector) The Zymbit Motherboard has a standard Raspberry Pi 40-way HAT connector. Mounting holes are also provided so that standard HATs may be used.\nNOTE: THIS CONNECTOR IS DESIGNED TO HAVE HATS INSERTED ON THE BOTTOM SIDE AS INDICATED BY THE HAT OUTLINE AND NOTE ON THE TOP SIDE\nTop side note that HATs go on other side Pi HATs insert on the bottom Motherboard\nBottom side Pi HAT outline where Pi HATs go Zymbit IO The Zymbit Motherboard provides general expansion capability for Raspberry Pi Compute Module Based products similar to the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 IO Board. It also has added features that can be utilized when using a Zymbit Secure Compute Module Product.\nBattery Connector (J1) The battery connector is a 1.00mm Pitch, 2-pin, JST PCB header that mates with housings with SHR-02V-S-B or similar headers. It takes 3.3V batteries and is used to power the RTC on the ZYMBIT SCM as well as power the security supervisor on the SCM in a low-power state when there is no primary power. See API documentation for uses.\nThe J14 PI BATT is a separate battery connector for powering the CM5 RTC. Please see the CM5 section for more detail.\nTamper Detection (J2) The Zymbit Motherboard includes two tamper detection circuits that help safeguard the system from physical tampering. These circuits can function independently or together, depending on how the board is configured.\nThe first circuit, Perimeter Loop 1, comprises four small red switches (SW1–SW4) located on the bottom side of the board. When all switches are closed or pressed down, the circuit loop is completed. If any of the switches are opened — for example, when someone removes or opens an enclosure — the loop is broken, and a tamper event is triggered. Tamper events from this loop can then be detected using the Zymbit API. This type of setup is ideal for detecting unauthorized access to the SEN 500 enclosure.\nThe second circuit, Perimeter Loop 2, is accessible through the connector labeled “Auxiliary” (J2) on the top side of the board. This connector is a 12 pin JST SURS connector (SM12B-SURS-TF(LF)(SN)) and mates with 12SUR-32S (premade cable harnesses). By default, this loop is closed using a built-in break-off tab (Tab 1 in the picture below), and it is used to detect when the Zymbit module is removed from the Motherboard. To enable the use of an external tamper circuit, such as a tamper mesh, Tab 1 must be cut. Cutting the tab breaks the internal loop and allows the board to detect events from an external setup. The external circuit will NOT work unless the tab is cut.\nUsing Tamper on auxiliary connector J2:\nThe pinout for J2:\nJ2 Pinout Connector To close a tamper loop, PERIM0 is the TX and PERIM1/PERIM2 are the RX. Connecting PERIM0 to either of the RX lines completes the tamper for the associated loop. This is not simply a constant voltage, it is a pseudo random encoded sequence.\nPerimeter 1: To use perimeter loop 1 (connected to internal tamper switches) on the auxiliary connector, solder bridge the pads R120 where is reads PERIM1 CONNECT on the BOTTOM side of the board. Because it is still connected to the tamper switches, to see a tamper event on this channel in this case, the tamper switches must be opened AND the auxiliary connection must also be broken.\nIf you do not plan to use PERIM1 on the external connector, consider cutting the tab with R120 off to prevent malicious access to the PERIM1 loop.\nPerimeter 2: To use perimeter loop 2 on the auxiliary connector, cut the tab in the picture below. This breaks the internal connection and exposes it to the auxiliary connector. Then connecting P3 and P5 on J2 closes the loop.\nPERIM1 loop enable PERIM tabs\nPERIM2 enable Perimeter 0 is the transmit, and the associated perimeters 1 and 2 are the receive loops.\nAuxiliary Connector (J2) J2 Pinout For tamper detection pins (pins 1, 3, 5) please see the previous section ZIO pins (pins 4, 6) these are general purpose auxiliary pins passed through from the Zymbit HSM. These pins are currently reserved for future use 3V3 power (pin 8): This is the 3.3V power output that comes from the Raspberry Pi Compute Module Security indicator signals (pins 9, 10): These are the signals used to drive the LEDs on the front panel. Please see LED indicator section for details. Example use to drive LEDs: Power button input: This pin connects to the Power button pin on the compute module after going through the HSM. Pull this pin low to activate. Please see the power button section for functionality. Security Header Pins Power button Pins Other Features Mass Storage Mount (MSD) and RPI Boot The Zymbit Motherboard has the ability to mass storage mount a plain CM5 in order to use the RPI Boot tools to flash an image. Because this can be a security vulnerability, several measures have to be taken to enable this functionality, and boards with this functionality enabled should only be used for development purposes and not be used in production environments.\nFirst, the CM5 must be removed, and R104 pads on the top side of the Zymbit HSM must be shorted. This can be accomplished by soldering a 0 ohm resistor or shorting the pads together with a solder blob or wire.\nSecond, the header labeled “BOOT”, J20, must have a jumper installed across it.\nNOTE: J20 should not be permanently installed as this prevents the compute module from booting off the eMMC and puts it in the MSD mode\nEnable rpiboot or MSD Resistor pad to short and jumper to install\nThe external USB ports are not available, and only the internal auxiliary USB is available. To utilize this port, a USB-to-header pin cable is required, like this or similar.\nCM5 RTC Battery (J14) The CM5 has a built-in RTC that can be powered by an external battery. There will be a constant load on the battery of a few micro amps even if the CM5 is powered. The battery connector is a 1.00mm Pitch, 2-pin, JST PCB header that mates with housings with SHR-02V-S-B or similar headers. It takes 3.3V batteries (like the Pi5 battery) and is used to power the RTC on the CM5.\nAdvanced: It is possible to connect the Zymbit RTC battery to the Pi RTC battery input and have both of them run at the same time. If you would like to power the CM5 RTC as well as the Zymbit HSM and RTC from the same battery, bridge the R121 pads together and install the battery to the Zymbit battery connector J14. Note that this will affect battery lifetime as the combined load from the CM5 and Zymbit HSM (although a few micro amps) :\nCM5 RTC Enable CM5 Features DIP Switch The CM5 introduces new features not on the CM4, and the DIP switch (S1) on the top side of the board allows users to take advantage of these features.\nCM5 Features DIP Switch Position 1: The CM5 has a dedicated PCIe power enable pin. Enabling this switch connects this signal to the enable the pin of the dedicated 3.3V supply for the M.2 PCIe connector. On a CM4 or SCM4, this pin is designated as Reserved and therefore should not be enabled on the DIP switch, which leaves it unconnected.\nPosition 2: The CM5 has a pin for controlling whether or not the ports for USB3 are powered. It is ACTIVE HIGH. By default this switch is not connected and the Zymbit Motherboard pulls the signal HGIH with a weak pull up meaning the USB3 ports will always be powered. If you would like the CM5 to control whether or not the USB3 ports are powered, close this switch. The CM5 will be able to then pull this line low.\nPosition 3: This is a hardware USB enable/disable switch. When the switch is open the external USB ports are disabled. Close the switch to enable the USB ports (default enabled).\nExternal Power, Auxiliary, and Expansion Boards The Zymbit Motherboard is designed to support expansion boards to offer additional functionality not natively integrated. These connections come through connector J24.\nExternal Power and Expansion Boards Signal Description Signal Name Pin Number Pin Number Signal Name Signal Description Tamper perimeter loop 1 receive signal PERIM_1 20 19 PERIM0 Tamper perimeter loops transmit signal Tamper perimeter loop 2 receive signal PERIM_2 18 17 GND Ground System power tie in (full protection with monitoring) +VJACK 16 15 +VJACK Barrel jack tie in (has full input power protection) Ground GND 14 13 GND Ground System power tie in (no protection with monitoring) +VIN_PRE 12 11 +VIN_PRE System power tie in (no protection with monitoring) General status line 2 nPSTAT2 10 9 nPSTAT1 General status line 1 Input to power button PWR_BTN_IN 8 7 3V3_STBY 3.3V standby voltage output System power tie in (no protection, no monitoring) +VIN 6 5 SM2_SCL Security supervisor I2C clock Ground GND 4 3 SM2_SDA Security supervisor I2C data Voltage monitor by security super visor. Goes through voltage divider ratio: 0.042 (4.4k/104.4k) POE_VEXT_MON 2 1 SM2_nIRQ_IN Security supervisor I2C interrupt line Use with a Zymkey The Zymbit Motherboard supports use with a Zymbit Zymkey. To use a Zymkey, a bare CM5 is required as the host device, not an SCM. A Zymkey and SCM can not be used together. A 10-pin double sided male header is needed to connect the Zymkey to J3 on the Zymbit Motherboard. This is so there are not exposed pins when a Zymkey is not in use, which could be a security vulnerability.\nIf the user has other IO on the normal I2C lines (GPIO2 and GPIO3) of the 40-pin header, alternative I2C GPIO pins can be used for the Zymkey. To use alternative pins, remove resistors R4 and R5 on the bottom side of the board designated as “Zymkey I2C Sel” and for resistors R6 and R7. This makes the Zymkey use GPIO 22 and GPIO 27 for the I2C communication. This change must also be made in the Zymbit software. See the Zymbit Zymkey documentation for changing I2C pins.\nConnector Function \u0026 Mating Connector Ref Type Function Mating Connector / Cable J18 USB Dual Stack (Type-A) External USB 2.0 Host Ports (with EN/OC protection) Standard USB-A male J19 AUX USB (5-pin header) Internal USB Port for auxiliary device connection 5-pin USB cable or custom harness: Ex1, Ex2 J25, J26 Mini HDMI 2.0 Video Output (via CM4/CM5), 5V powered with ESD protection Mini HDMI to HDMI cable J6 RJ45 Ethernet (MagJack) 10/100/1000 Mbps LAN with PoE support and ESD protection Standard Ethernet cable (RJ45) J9 4-pin POE Power Header PoE pass-through to optional Zymbit PoE expansion board Zymbit PoE Expansion Connector J12 M.2 M-Key PCIe-connected NVMe or expansion device (15W power budget) M-Key NVMe or compatible PCIe device J11 22-pin FFC (0.5mm pitch) CSI-2 Camera or MIPI (camera/display) interface depending on host (CM4/CM5) 22-pin 0.5mm pitch FFC cable J13 22-pin FFC (0.5mm pitch) DSI Display or MIPI (camera/display) interface depending on host (CM4/CM5) 22-pin 0.5mm pitch FFC cable J5 4-pin Fan Header (same as Pi 5) 5V PWM fan (not populated by default) with CM4 PWM control is not available.

Keys generated using the BIP32 wallet with gen_wallet_master_seed()/gen_wallet_child_key() keys are not removed on reboot. The BIP32 wallet keys can be used as a workaround for B1 units.\nFor example,\nInstead of:\nkey_slot = gen_key_pair(\"secp256k1\")\nUse:\nseed = zymkey.client.gen_wallet_master_seed(\"secp256k1\", \"\", \"wallet_name\")\nkey_slot = zymkey.client.gen_wallet_child_key(seed, 0, False)\nFrom this point on you can use the key_slot in the same manner to get_public_key(key_slot) or remove_key(key_slot)\nNotes: The problem does not affect the use of slots 0 through 15. The problem does not affect public keys stored in the Foreign key store. BIP32 wallets are hierarchical key stores, meaning removing the wallet master seed will remove all the keys in that wallet; removing a parent will remove all child slots of the parent. See BIP32 for more information. BIP32 wallets can be recovered if you setup a recovery method using either BIP39 mnemonics, or SLIP39 Shamir’s Secret Sharing of mnemonics. Zymbit supports both methods. Your particular application of keys may lend itself to different key hierarchy strategies - you could put one key in each wallet and create many wallets or put many keys in one wallet. For details on wallets, you can see https://docs.zymbit.com/tutorials/digital-wallet/ If you are creating multiple wallets, each wallet must have a unique name. This only affects SCMs with firmware 01.02.02release. This does not affect the HSM6.\nSecure Compute Module SCM Functional Architecture Highlights 100% pin compatible with RPi CM4, all configurations. 100% code compatible with RPi Easy to Scale Pre-encrypted file system Notice The pre-installed image is encrypted and cannot be replaced via rpiboot in the field.

Symptom is Bootware Updates cannot access USB Endpoints to get images. You won’t see the problem with the 11/19 release. The 11/19 release can be downloaded from here: Pi5 Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64-bit 2024-11-19\nAugust 2025 Ubuntu 24.04.3 (Released 8/7/25)\nThe Ubuntu team released 24.04.3 (updated Noble) on 8/7/25. The image straight from the Pi Imager can be used. There is no longer a need to use the daily image. 24.04.3 improves hardware support for the Pi5 and CM5. Ubuntu 24.04.3 works with Zymbit products on the platforms noted above (Pi5, CM5, Pi4, CM4). Bootware® 1.3.2-3\nBug fixes: #202: Pi5/CM5 with 16GB RAM are showing up as 8GB when booting from u-boot Bootware® 1.3.2-2\nBug fixes: #201: Adds Bootware support for Pi5 Rev 1.1 hardware. July 2025 Bootware® 1.3.2-1\nFeatures: #189: Add static network configuration option. See Advanced Networking Options for details. #190: Add ignore_low_ram=true flag. Ignores the low ram check in zboot to download images into the /DATA partition on devices that have less than 3GB RAM space. See Low Memory Platforms for details. NOTE: Zymbit recommends always using platforms with at least 4GB RAM. #191: Add feature to sync time from Zymbit HSM in zboot. Also add a flag to override, disable_cert_time_check=false. The new feature will try to sync the zboot system clock with the Zymbit HSM, whichever is later. If disable_cert_time_check=true and neither the zboot time nor the HSM time is reasonably current, a future time is set. This feature is included to cover situations where certificates need to be provided to bring up Wi-Fi interfaces, which will perform a system time verification before bringing up the wlan0 interface. Bug fixes: #197: Buildroot Wi-Fi related firmware added for all platforms. Prevented wlan0 from showing up in zboot for platforms running Ubuntu 22.04. #193: zbcli overrides existing wifi related config values with defaults on some parameters. If the user Save and Exits the zbcli update-config menu without touching the wifi related parameters, existing wifi configs would be overriden with defaults. The default values turned off wifi and set the psk hash to an empty string. zbcli now only changes wifi configs when the user touches the wifi configs in the zbcli update-config menu. #194: dhcp or ntp timeout defaults were too long. By default both dhcp and ntp retried up to 30 times at possibly a minute a interval, which could have a user sitting at a screen for 30min - 1 hr. Reduced timeouts to 3 retries. Open bugs: #196: overlay .zi images saves files as root regardless of what it was owned by before. #195: If you delete the DATA partition with your update policy not set to BOTH, zboot does not inject the new data key into the non-updated partition’s initramfs. If the user switches to the non-updated partition, the data key will return bad passphrase from initramfs. The system will timeout, boot up, and unlock the partition’s LUKS volume. Access to the shared LUKS data partition will be unavailable. April 2025 Bootware® 1.3.1-2\nBug fixes: #188: sudo zbcli update-config --update-endpoint https://192.168.42.125/my.zi --update-endpoint-cert myCert.crt doesn’t work. Endpoint certs now work. #187: Bootware: --data-part-size-mb doesn’t apply correctly. Now works either interactively or non-interactively. March 2025 Bootware® 1.3.1-1\nFeatures: #182 Add support for Pi Zero 2W (ZYMKEY, HSM4, HSM6) Bookworm 64 bit and Bullseye 64 bit Uses the DATA partition as an alternative for Pis with limited RAM, like the Pi Zero 2W. Slight optimizations on Update writes to the encrypted A/B partitions. #184 zbcli update has a new --no-pre-verify flag. Normally the zi image is verified in userspace and also within zboot. Setting the --no-pre-verify flags skips the verify of the image/endpoint in userspace before launching into zboot, which saves some time. The images are always verified in zboot. WARNING: Setting this flag can lead to lost data, as the verification in zboot may require reformatting to make space for URL endpoints on limited RAM devices. #185 Additional information is logged in /boot/zboot.log. Bug fixes: #180: Bootware: zbcli update hostname/password cannot contain an @ character. Zymbit Driver Package\nBug fixes: #186: zkifc: Babbling with time sync issues. Setting the time forward or backwards caused zkifc to think it lost contact with the Zymkey. Babbling messages would result with the potential to fill logs with rapid messages. Babbling messages are now limited, and recovery has been improved. Fixed in zkifc 1.2-37.

Adds new feature in recovery to override recovery mechanisms and “boot up anyway”; clears counters and attempts to boot. Adds -y option to zbcli rollback-swap for non-interactive rollback. Adds specifying platform as Pi4 or Pi5 to bootstrap install for DevOps systems that are not running on a real Pi. Allows non-interactive bootstrap of Bootware tools. Bug fixes. See Bootware Troubleshooting for details. September 2024 Bootware® 1.2.0 Release (1.2.0-30):\nAdds support for Pi 5 Adds all new rust-based user interface Adds support for HSM4 and HSM6 u-boot updated to linux 6.6 kernel Bug fixes. See Bootware Troubleshooting for details. June 2024 Bootware 1.1 General Platform Support - Along with the SCM-based products, Bootware 1.1 includes cross-platform support for ZYMKEY on CM4 and RPi4.\nThe Zymbit Products also include Bookworm 64-bit support.\nOther significant enhancements in Bootware 1.1: Issue #142 - FIXED. OS updates that change boot.scr can prevent future boot. Affects Ubuntu. Although the PI version of Ubuntu does not use U-Boot, Ubuntu’s dpkg kernel update re-writes the file /boot/firmware/boot.scr. boot.scr was used by Bootware 1.0, and a re-write of the file could leave the system unable to boot. Bootware 1.1 no longer relies on the file.\nEnhancement - The common data partition is now encrypted and the LUKS key is locked by the Zymbit HSM.\nApril 2024 Bootware 1.0 is now released for General Availability. Along with Bootware 1.0 GA, The SCM/SEN product line now officially supports both Bullseye 64-bit and Ubuntu 22.04 64-bit.\nMarch 2024 Raspberry PI OS updated kernels to 6.6.y on March 12th. The kernel no longer overrides an upstream kernel decision to force the base number of the main GPIO controller to be global GPIO 0. If the ZYMKEY4 WAKE_PIN number is not set, the ZYMKEY will not bind. The install_zk_sw.sh script has been updated to set the WAKE_PIN number for you if it detects a kernel version of 6.6.x or later. If you update the kernel on an existing installation without making the change below, you will see 5 flashes per second continuously.\nFor RPI4, RPI5, and CM4 platforms, you will need to set the WAKE_PIN in the following manner:\nDetermine the numbering for GPIO4 by examining /sys/kernel/debug/gpio for the number associated with GPIO4, then set an environment variable in the Zymbit environment variable file:\nsudo su wake_pin=`grep GPIO4 /sys/kernel/debug/gpio | sed -r 's/[^0-9]*([0-9]*).*/\\1/'` echo \"wake_pin=$wake_pin\" # sanity check value is set echo \"ZK_GPIO_WAKE_PIN=$wake_pin\" \u003e /var/lib/zymbit/zkenv.conf systemctl restart zkifc The kernel version can be retrieved with uname -r. As of version 6.6.20, the numbering is: RPI4=516 RPI5=575 CM4=516\nYou do not need to do anything for new installations as the install_zk_sw.sh will take care of things for you.\nDecember 2023 We have added support for Bookworm (64-bit) on the Pi5, PI4 and CM4 for the ZYMKEY, HSM4, and HSM6. Follow the Getting Started guides to install and encrypt.\nOctober 2023 Secure Compute Module moved from Revision A to Revision B. The Zymbit Driver Package did not change. The root filesystem partitioning changed from 100% of the eMMC to 50% of the eMMC (encrypted). This was done to accommodate future support for Bootware, which is available in a Preview mode. A utility is included to repartition to 100% (encrypted) if required.\nSee the Troubleshooting/FAQ for more information on the changes from Rev A to Rev B of the SCM itself. For Bootware to use Wi-Fi to retrieve images from remote endpoints on Pi4/CM4 running either Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy) or Bullseye, you must use the latest dtb file, available here:. ↩︎ ↩︎ ↩︎ ↩︎\nTo install Bootware on a PiZero2W running Bullseye64, you need to update the boot artifacts prior to installation.

There are no additional steps required.\nInstallation instructions for Ubuntu 24.04.3 with SEN-500/CM5 If you are using Ubuntu 24.04.3 with the CM5 and the Zymbit motherboard, you only need to copy the pciex1-compat-pi5.dtbo overlay (from Bookworm firmware) into /boot/firmware/overlays, and add the following to config.txt ( see Github Issue 6134 for background ):\n[cm5] dtoverlay=pciex1-compat-pi5,mmio-hi Installation instructions for Bookworm with older kernels For Bookworm, the in-tree igc Linux driver is not included by default as part of the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s older official kernel packages. The process below has been tested and validated for the 6.1.93 Raspberry Pi kernel paired with an IOCrest SY-PEX24075 M.2 adapter card, though most any sub-7 watt M.2 card using the I225-V controller should theoretically work.\nThere are two options for installation: using prebuilt .deb packages, which target kernel 6.1.93, or building and installing from source.\nOption 1: Install from Prebuilt Debian Packages This option will install a prebuilt kernel 6.1.93 package, including the necessary igc module, and will work on any existing Debian-based SEN. As part of the installation process, the system’s initramfs (if one is present) will be regenerated, allowing the use of LUKS-encrypted root filesystems to continue working.\nNotice On some newer systems (Debian Bookworm and later), the kernel image and config.txt files may instead be located in the /boot/firmware directory; check the mount point of the first partition on your SD card/eMMC to determine whether this is the case. The prebuilt 6.1.93 kernel package will always install to /boot, so depending on your exact setup, you may have to either remount /dev/mmcblk0p1 at /boot before running dpkg, or else move the installed files from /boot into /boot/firmware after the installation is complete. Download the prebuilt packages, then copy the linux-image-*_arm64.deb, linux-libc-dev_*_arm64.deb, and (optionally) linux-headers-*_arm64.deb files onto the target system.\nThe linux-headers package is required if you plan on doing any out-of-tree kernel module-related development. Otherwise, it is not required for the system to properly run. As root, install the packages using dpkg:\ndpkg -i *.deb Edit /boot/config.txt to boot from the newly installed kernel image. The prebuilt packages will install the kernel at /boot/vmlinuz-6.1.93-v8+. You must either manually copy/rename this file to /boot/kernel8.img, or edit /boot/config.txt to change (or add, if it’s missing) the line kernel=vmlinuz-6.1.93-v8+, otherwise the system will not boot the correct kernel image.\nDepending on which versions of the kernel you are coming from and moving to, you may also need to install an updated devicetree blob. If the kernel was installed from the prebuilt Debian packages, this can be done by copying /usr/lib/linux-image-6.1.93-v8+/broadcom/bcm2711-rpi-cm4.dtb into /boot (or /boot/firmware, depending on your system’s layout).\nOption 2: Build and Install from Source This option is much more flexible than the alternative and allows working with custom kernels, but requires a suitable Linux kernel build environment. You will need to build the entire kernel in order to obtain the System.map and other files required for depmod, as well as to ensure the igc module version matches that of the core kernel.\nIt is highly recommended that you compile the kernel on a non-Pi workstation. The CM4 is capable of building its own Linux kernel, but doing so will take upwards of 1-2 hours on the Cortex-A72 CPU and require several GiB of disk space. If building on a non-aarch64 host, ensure you have an aarch64 cross toolchain installed on the build machine; you can install one from apt, dnf, or pacman on most x86_64 Linux distributions, or download a prebuilt tarball directly from ARM. Either of the bare-metal or GNU/Linux targets will work. Also, be sure to install your distribution’s required Linux build dependencies; consult your distro’s documentation for specifics.\nObtain RPi Linux sources and checkout the appropriate commit for kernel 6.1.93:\nAs of this writing, the desired commit is at the HEAD of the rpi-6.1.y branch. Adding a --depth 1 argument to the clone command will therefore yield the correct commit HEAD and save significant time, but this will change should more commits be added to this branch in the future.\nIf you wish to clone the entire source tree and history, the gix command will do to so much faster than git (it can be installed with cargo install gitoxide), though note that gix does not support the --branch option.\ngit clone --branch rpi-6.1.y https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux.git git checkout fbd8b3facb36ce888b1cdcf5f45a78475a8208f2 Create a KBuild .config file to target the SEN’s Pi CM4. If building on an aarch64 host with a native toolchain, omit the ARCH and CROSS_COMPILE flags from the below command.\n$TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX should be the prefix of your cross toolchain, such that invoking ${TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX}gcc from the command line will launch the cross GCC.\nThe kernel build system will respect the $ARCH and $CROSS_COMPILE environment variables, if you don’t wish to specify them on the make command line.\nmake ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=$TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX bcm2711_defconfig Modify the generated .config file to add support for the igc driver module (CONFIG_IGC).\nAlternatively, the option can be found within the KConfig interactive interface under Device Drivers \u003e Network device support \u003e Ethernet driver support \u003e Intel devices \u003e Intel(R) Ethernet Controller I225-LM/I225-V support. scripts/config --module CONFIG_IGC Build the kernel and modules.\nTo create .deb packages containing the kernel, modules, headers, and libc, you can instead specify the bindeb-pkg target to make. This requires either building on a Debian-based host, or installing the necessary Debian package development tools onto your system. The kernel .deb files themselves will be output into your current parent directory. You can then install them onto the target system by following the above steps for Option 1: Install from Prebuilt Debian Packages.\nIf building directly on the target SEN system, you can invoke make modules_install install after the build is completed to install the kernel \u0026 modules into their appropriate locations.\nIt is also possible to package the kernel into a binary tarball, RPM, or snap. Run make help for more details.\nmake ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=$TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX -j$(nproc) Performance Information The M.2 slot on the SEN Devkit board is a PCIe Gen. 2 x1 bus, which has a bandwidth cap of 4 Gib/s—enough to support the SY-PEX24075 card’s maximum link speed of 2.5Gib/s. Note, however, that it is not quite enough to achieve maximum bandwidth for simultaneous send/receive operations. In such cases, the driver will prioritize Rx bandwidth (as it should), and allocate whatever remains to Tx. Performance metrics from iperf3 are shown below. The SEN was connected via a LAN cable directly to the 2.5G ethernet port on a Linux PC and two iperf3 client-server sessions were established, one for each direction of communication.\nON PC:\n$ iperf3 --udp 5001 --client \u003cSEN IP Address\u003e --bitrate 2.5g --time n --length 65507 ...

To update your local key, do the following:\ncurl -L https://zk-sw-repo.s3.amazonaws.com/apt-zymkey-pubkey.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor --yes -o /usr/share/keyrings/zymbit.gpg For those of you that are on older installations, make sure the signed-by option is included in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zymbit.list,\nThis parameter - [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/zymbit.gpg]\nThe following will check and fix for you,\nsudo sed -i 's/^deb https/deb [signed-by=\\/usr\\/share\\/keyrings\\/zymbit.gpg] https/' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zymbit.list Wake-Pin Issues for upgrades to Kernel 6.6 and later The installation script takes care of the following for you. If you are doing a new installation, you should not have to worry about the following. If you already installed the Zymbit Driver Package and then upgraded the kernel to something beyond 6.6, please note the following.\nRaspberry PI OS Bookworm updated the kernel to version 6.6.y in March 2024. The kernel no longer overrides an upstream kernel decision to force the base number of the main GPIO controller to be global GPIO 0. If the WAKE_PIN number is not set, the ZYMKEY will not bind. You will see 5 flashes per second continuously.For RPI4, RPI5, and CM4 platforms, you will need to set the WAKE_PIN in the following manner:\nDetermine the numbering for GPIO4 by examining /sys/kernel/debug/gpio for the number associated with GPIO4, then set an environment variable in the Zymbit environment variable file:\nsudo su wake_pin=`grep GPIO4 /sys/kernel/debug/gpio | sed -r 's/[^0-9]*([0-9]*).*/\\1/'` echo \"wake_pin=$wake_pin\" # sanity check value is set echo \"ZK_GPIO_WAKE_PIN=$wake_pin\" \u003e /var/lib/zymbit/zkenv.conf systemctl restart zkifc As of 6.6.20, the numbering is: RPI4=516 RPI5=575 CM4=516 CM5=573\nCPU Scaling Governor We have seen some issues with the scaling cpu governor on the raspberry pi interfere with the i2c bus. This sometimes causes the zymkey to be put into a odd state or return failures from operations that get optimized out by the governor. The raspberry pi sets the scaling governor to be “ondemand” by default. We recommend switching this mode to “performance” to get the best out of the zymkey. Details:\nResources CPU Scaling Governor How to set cpu governor to performance. View resource Unattended-upgrades When encrypting your rootfs, we highly recommend turning off unattended-upgrades prior to the encryption process. In some cases primarily with Ubuntu, during an update/upgrade after encryption, the update-initramfs process may fail and leave the system unable to boot.\nTo mitigate this issue, remove the service unattended-upgrades:\nCheck /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades. Make sure the following lines are set to 0,\nAPT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists \"0\"; APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade \"0\"; Stop and remove the unattended-upgrade service:\nsudo systemctl stop unattended-upgrades sudo systemctl disable unattended-upgrades sudo apt-get remove --purge -y unattended-upgrades Running a 32-bit version of Operating System As of March 2023, Raspberry PI OS 32-bit images install the 64-bit kernel along with the 32-bit root filesystem. This does not allow our installation script to work. In order to properly install on an 32-bit system, edit /boot/config.txt and add the following line to the bottom of the file, then reboot.\narm_64bit=0\nProducts Q: Where can I learn about and/or pre-order future products? Expand for Answer A: Sign up for our new product email updates at the bottom of Zymbit’s homepage.\nQ: What are the differences between Zymbit’s Products? Expand for Answer A: See the Product Comparison Matrix for the differences between Zymkey, HSM4, and HSM6. Please reach out with any further questions.\nQ: How much power do Zymbit products consume? Expand for Answer Zymkey-RPi (3.3V): idle approx. 1mA; max active \u003c 25mA with LED off, \u003c 35mA with LED on. Zymkey-USB (5V): idle approx. 1.5mA; max active \u003c 40mA with LEDs off, \u003c 60mA with LEDs on. See Power Quality for more information.\nQ: What is the expected battery life for Zymbit Products? Expand for Answer Compatibility Q: Which operating systems does Zymbit support? Expand for Answer Q: Which SBCs are compatible with Zymbit Products?

No RSA support is provided in hardware. RSA support is provided via hardware lock/unlock of PKCS11 store on host.\nQ: Do Zymbit Products work with Arduino? Expand for Answer A: We have no plans to release an Arduino shield version. While we love Arduinos and use them all the time, they generally don’t have enough resources to handle cryptographic operations at this level.\nQ: Do Zymbit Products work with BeagleBone? Expand for Answer A: Zymbit does not officially support the BeagleBoard platform at this time.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Release Notes - Latest Release 3/28/2025 (Zymbit Ref: RC-25.01) …","ref":"/troubleshooting/general/","tags":"","title":"General FAQ \u0026 Troubleshooting"},{"body":" Process of Updating on Pi plaforms with limited RAM space. Certain Pi platforms, such as the Pi Zero 2W, may have as little as 512MB of RAM. This is not enough space to process a Bootware update from a URL endpoint entirely in memory. In lieu of RAM, Bootware will attempt to use storage space instead. The space Bootware uses is within the DATA partition.\nThe first time Bootware Updates, it creates A, B, and a DATA partition of a user-specified size. If the Pi is deemed to have insufficient RAM (currently less that 3GB), Bootware will override the user supplied size of the DATA partition, and create three approximately equal size partitions - A, B, and DATA. The DATA partition will be used for image checking and processing in place of RAM.\nWhen the Update runs from a URL Endpoint, the DATA partition will receive the image download. The signatures will be verified from the DATA partition and files will be copied from the DATA partition to the A, B, or both partitions as specified in the Update configuration.\nNote that the DATA partition will never be deleted during an Update process. If the DATA partition exists, Bootware will attempt to use it. If the existing DATA partition is too small, the Update process will fail and you will boot back into your existing configuration. To allow the future Updates to succeed, delete the DATA partition and the next run of Update will re-partition your A, B, and DATA partitions with sufficient space to complete the update process. For standard Bootware installations, the DATA partition will be partition 4. To delete with parted, (WARNING! You will lose all data in partition 4)\nsudo parted -s /dev/mmcblk0 rm 4\nNotes on ignore_low_ram flag: 1.3.2 and later includes an ignore_low_ram=true flag. Setting the flag to true ignores the low ram check in zboot to download images into the /DATA partition on devices that have less than 3GB RAM space. If not set (default) or set to false, Bootware proceeds as described above.\nUse zbconfig to set the flag,\nsudo zbconfig -set /boot/firmware/zb_config.enc ignore_low_ram=true Notes on Bootware Shared Data Partition: Bootware creates an encrypted partition 4 called the DATA partition. This partition is viewable from either the A or B root partitions of the device. Bootware will always try to create this data partition when it applies an update. The size of this partition is specified by the user in zbcli update-config -\u003e data partition size [default is 512 MB]. The DATA partition will not be resized or deleted until the user deletes the partition. NEW for 1.3.1 For updates that are downloaded from an http/https endpoint: If Bootware detects insufficient RAM (currently set to less than 3GB), it will try to create and use the data partition as space to pull the image update. If the DATA partition already exists, it will try to use that space. If the DATA partition does not exist, like on the initial update, the DATA partition creation overrides the size given by the user - Bootware creates a partition the size of 1/3rd of the SD card. For this reason we recommend an SD card of at least 32GB. This partition always has the label /dev/mapper/cryptrfs_DATA created from /dev/mmcblk0p4. The data partition will always be unlocked on boot up and will be available for the user to mount in userspace. I.E mount /dev/mapper/cryptrfs_DATA This partition can be used like an external drive for zbcli update-config –update-endpoint=/dev/mapper/cryptrfs_DATA to pull a .zi update from.

The steps below outline how to take your existing CM4 solution directly to an SCM using bootware. The end result of this procedure will be an image in zi format ready for transfer to an SCM.\nSteps Start with Bookworm, Bullseye or Ubuntu 22.04 image on the CM4. Load Zymbit Driver Package on the CM4 (a ZYMBIT HSM is not necessary). Load/Install Bootware on the CM4. Use zbcli imager to create a zi image signed with software key. Use Bootware to pre-configure the SCM with a known good A/B partition. This is just in case the CM4 image has any problem. Load zi image on SCM with zbcli update. 1. Start with Bookworm, Bullseye or Ubuntu Follow the standard instructions from Raspberry Pi Foundation using rpiboot and the Pi Imager to load Bookworm or Bullseye Lite 64-bit or Ubuntu Server 22.04 (jammy). Load all of the necessary software and debug and test your application.\n2. Load the Zymbit Driver Package on the CM4 Once the image is put together and loaded on the SCM, load Zymbit Driver Package. For now, Zymbit hardware is not needed. You only need to complete the software installation.

Install Bootware on the CM4 Load the Bootware software. Part of the zi image creation includes all of the Bootware software. Download the Bootware software to the SCM. The Bootware software can be downloaded with curl:\ncurl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zymbit-applications/zb-bin/main/install.sh | sudo bash sudo zbcli install The installation script will require a reboot. With everything in place, you can now run zbcli imager to create an image.\n4. Run zbcli imager and sign with a software-based key on the CM4 sudo zbcli imager zbcli imager will build your zi image. At the end of the zi image creation (takes 15-20 minutes, based on the size of your image), your output location will have the private key file, public key file, and the zi image. You will need your public key file along with the zi file to move to the SCM. You should also keep track of your private key file to use if you need to create and sign additional images. The zi image and Public key can be used via local SCM storage such as a USB stick, or via the network and an HTTPS endpoint. Copy the zi file and public key file to the endpoint.\n5. Setup the SCM Prepare your SCM with Bootware and an A/B partition, and a known good image, such as our example image. This is the safest way to insure should something go wrong loading your CM4 image, you will have a way to recover. The Getting Started Guide details the steps. Complete those steps first.\n6. Load the zi file from your ENDPOINT to the SCM Copy your Public key file to a local folder. Run sudo zbcli update and double-check the settings are correct. Enter “n” to correct the configuration. Specify the ENDPOINT (USB or HTTPS) where the zi file is located. If you need to correct anything, use zbcli update-config. Let zbcli update continue. It will confirm your ENDPOINT and prompt for your public key file. Enter your public key file. The process will then continue to load your zi image onto your partitions and attempt to boot up on that partition.\nIf successful, the SCM will end up successfully bound, and up and running on an encrypted partition. Use lsblk to verify the encrypted partition. You should see four partitions, the root, the Active partition (mounted as cryptrfs_A or cryptrfs_B), the backup partition (not mounted), and the shared DATA partition. The blue LED should be blinking once every three seconds.

Expand for Answer A: Bootware 1.1 runs on the Secure Compute Module based products - the Secure Edge Node, SCM Development kits, SCM modules. Bootware 1.1 can also run with a ZYMKEY4 on a Dev Kit with an SCM, or with a ZYMKEY on a Raspberry Pi4.\nQ: What Operating Systems are supported? Expand for Answer A: Bootware 1.1 supports the following OS options:\nBookworm 64-bit Bullseye 64-bit Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy) 64-bit Q: Can I use Bootware to switch Operating Systems from Bookworm to Bullseye or Ubuntu 22.04? Expand for Answer A: Yes, you can switch between the supported Operating Systems. Note: The CM4/SCM firmware must include bootloader version 2023/01/11 or later in order to work with Ubuntu 22.04. The version can be verified with the vcgencmd bootloader_version command.\nQ: Can I use a custom kernel build? Expand for Answer A: Yes, if it is based off of one of the supported OS images - Bullseye or Ubuntu 22.04. You will need to supply your kernel and the corresponding modules from your build. You will need to link or rename your kernel image kernel8.img for Bookworm/Bullseye, or vmlinuz for Ubuntu.\nQ: What are the partitioning schema? Expand for Answer A: Bootware 1.1 primarily consists of three partitioning schemes:\nBoot 512MB, RootA: Approximately 50%, RootB: Approximately 50%, Encrypted Data partition 512MB Boot 512MB, RootA: Approximately 100%, Encrypted Data partition 512MB Boot 512MB, RootA: Approximately 50%, Encrypted Data partition 512MB Q: Are the partitions encrypted? Expand for Answer A: Yes, the Root and Data partitions are encrypted with LUKS encryption. The Root partitions are protected by separate keys, i.e. RootA can only be unlocked with its key; the same key cannot unlock RootB. The Data partition is encrypted with a shared key between A and B; the Data partition is accessible by both RootA and RootB. The Boot partition is not encrypted.\nQ: What types of curves are used to sign and verify zi images? Expand for Answer A: The sign/verify process relies on ECDSA-based curves, in particular secp256k1. Public/Private key pairs can be generated in either software or Zymbit HSM hardware. The ZYMKEY uses software keys.\nQ: Is there Bare Metal Recovery?

Zymbit Secure Edge Node (SEN). This device uses Max Linear’s (formerly Exar Corp.) xr17v35x family of chipsets. The process has been tested and validated for the 6.6.31 Raspberry Pi kernel that ships with Debian Bookworm paired with an IOCrest SI-ADA15069 M.2 adapter card.\nBuilding. The IOCrest unit ships with a CD containing working driver code for pre-6.x kernels, located in the EXAR directory on the disc. For convenience, a link to the driver package is also provided here. For kernel 6.0 and later, a patch file is provided below.\nInstall the required build tools. On Debian-based systems: sudo apt install build-essential linux-headers patch Obtain and extract xr17_linux_driver_v2.6.zip.\nEdit the Makefile and change SUBDIRS to M in line 13.\nIf installing on a 6.0 or newer kernel, apply this patch to xr17v35x.c. Follow the steps in the driver package’s readme section 3.2A to unbind the serial ports from the generic driver.\nBuild the module by running make.\nLoad the driver into the kernel:\ninsmod ./xr17v35x.ko The serial ports should now be listed as /dev/ttyXR*.\nInstallation. You may wish to install the driver module so that it is automatically loaded on boot. This section outlines the process required to do so.\nNotice Linux kernel modules are bound to the specific kernel version against which they are built. If the device had previously been working but no longer does after a recent system upgrade, it’s likely that a new kernel was installed and the driver was not recompiled. To remedy this, follow the steps in this guide while running the newly installed kernel. Install xr17v35x.ko into /lib/modules: OPTIONAL: to compress the xr17v35x.ko module, run sudo \u003ccompression-program\u003e /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/char/xr17v35x.ko after make install and before running depmod, where \u003ccompression-program\u003e is xz, gzip, etc. cd \u003cpath-to-xr17-lnx2.6.32-and-newer-pak_ver2.6\u003e sudo make install sudo depmod -a Create a file with the following contents called 00-xrserial.rules in /etc/udev/rules.d to ensure device the works across reboots. This will unbind the PCIe device from linux’s generic PCI serial driver and then reload the vendor-specific driver module. If more than one PCIe serial device is present and the below rule doesn’t work, try adding KERNEL==\u003cpath\u003e, to the beginning of the line below, where \u003cpath\u003e is the PCI bus path value used in step 3.2.A of the driver package’s readme. # MaxLinear PCIe dual DB-9 serial port ACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"pci\", ATTR{class}==\"0x070002\", ATTR{vendor}==\"0x13a8\", ATTR{device}==\"0x0352\", ATTR{revision}==\"0x03\", \\ ATTR{driver_override}=\"xrserial\", \\ RUN+=\"/bin/sh -c 'echo $kernel \u003e /sys/$devpath/driver/unbind'\", \\ RUN+=\"/sbin/modprobe -r xr17v35x\", \\ RUN+=\"/sbin/modprobe xr17v35x\" ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"This page outlines the steps required to get PCIe DB9 serial ports up …","ref":"/device-addons/xr17v3521-dual-pcie-uart/","tags":"","title":"Driver Installation/Configuration for M.2 Exar Corp.

The following rules must be observed when using these interfaces:\nAbsolute path names must be provided. For destination filenames, the permissions of the path (or existing file) must be set: Write permissions for all. Write permissions for common group: in this case, user zymbit must be added to the group that has permissions for the destination directory path and/or existing file. Destination path must be fully owned by user and/or group zymbit. Similar rules exist for source filenames: Read permissions for all. Read permissions for common group: in this case, user zymbit must be added to the group that has permissions for the source directory path and/or existing file. Source path must be fully owned by user and/or group zymbit. Crypto Features Random Number Generation This feature is useful when the default host random number generator is suspected of having cryptographic weakness. It can also be used to supplement existing random number generation sources. Zymkey bases its random number generation on an internal TRNG (True Random Number Generator) and performs well under Fourmilab’s ent.\nData Locker Zymkey includes a feature, called Data Locking. This feature is essentially an AES encryption of the data block followed by an ECDSA signature trailer.\nData Locker Keys In addition to a unique ECDSA private/public key pair, each Zymkey has two unique AES keys that are programmed at the factory.\nECDSA Operations Each Zymkey comes out of the factory with three (Zymkey 4i/HSM4) or 12 (HSM6) unique ECDSA private/public key pairs. These private keys are randomly programmed within hardware at the time of manufacture and never exported. In fact, Zymbit doesn’t even know what the value of the private keys are.\nThere are three ECDSA operations available:\nGenerate signature: The Zymkey is capable of generating an ECDSA signature. Verification signature: The Zymkey is capable of verifying an ECDSA signature. Export the ECDSA public key: This saves the public key to a file in PEM format. This operation is useful for generating a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). Other Features LED The Zymkey has an LED which can be turned on, off or flashed at an interval.\ni2c Address For Zymkeys with an i2c interface, the base address can be changed to work around addressing conflicts. The default address is 0x30, but can be changed in the ranges 0x30 - 0x37 and 0x60 - 0x67.\nTap Sensitivity The Zymkey has an accelerometer which can perform tap detection. The sensitivity of the tap detection is configurable.\nProgramming Language Support Currently, C, C++ and Python are supported.\nBinding Before a Zymkey can be effectively used on a host computer, it must be “bound” to it. Binding is a process where a “fingerprint” is made which is composed of the host computer and its SD card serial numbers as well as the Zymkey serial number. If the host computer or SD card is changed from the time of binding, the Zymkey will refuse to accept commands.\nTo learn more about binding your zymkey, go to the Zymbit Community “Getting Started” page for your Zymkey model (e.g. Getting Started with ZYMKEY).\nHSM4 Soft Bind Lock Unlike Zymkey, HSM4 does not have a physical lock tab that is cut to lock the host binding. Instead, it has a software API for locking the binding to the host. See the soft bind lock API description for more information.\nHSM6 Soft Bind Lock See “HSM4: Soft Bind Lock” above.\nECDH ECDH with some Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) is available. The available KDFs include:\nnone: The raw pre-master secret is returned. rfc5869: This KDF can be invoked with SHA256 or SHA512 as the hashing function. pbkdf2: Like rfc5869, SHA256 or SHA512 can be specified. Koblitz Curve Support In addition to NIST P-256 which is available on Zymkey and HSM4, the Koblitz 256 bit curve is available as well.\nMore Key Slots HSM6 now has 12 factory pre-configured NIST P-256 key slots and 512 key pairs for generated key pair and digital wallet allocation for NIST P-256 or Koblitz 256. All of these key slots can be used for ECDSA as well as ECDH operations. It is also possible to remove the keys in the 512 key pair store and also prohibit public key export.\nForeign Public Keyring 128 public key slots are available to form a public key store for storing foreign party public keys. Like the 512 key pair store, public keys can be removed and prohibited from export.\nDigital Wallet HSM6 provides APIs which allow the creation of 1 or more digital wallets per BIP 32/39/44. The number of master seeds and child nodes is only limited by the number of key pairs provided for in the 512 byte key pair store. The BIP 39 feature provides the mnemonic sentence using the 2048 word English dictionary.\nBattery and Temperature Monitoring The HSM6 has APIs for reading the battery voltage as well as monitoring policies for taking action if certain thresholds are exceeded.\nBattery Monitoring The Battery Monitoring feature provides for 1 of 2 actions if the battery voltage below specified threshold (settable from 2.5V or lower via API).\nself-destruct:\nIf the battery voltage goes lower than the threshold, destroy all key material. Good for use cases where a low battery voltage is interpreted as an attempt to attack the low power tamper detect operation. sleep-until-battery-recovery:\nDo not permit full functionality until the battery has gone above the threshold. Good for use cases where battery replacement is desirable. Temperature Monitoring The Temperature Monitoring feature provides protection from attacks that are based on manipulation of temperature (e.g. memory freeze attacks). If invoked, the system may be configured to destroy keys if temperature thresholds are exceeded.\n","categories":"","description":"Zymbit Driver API Documentation","excerpt":"Zymbit Driver API Documentation","ref":"/api/","tags":"","title":"API Documentation"},{"body":"Overview Blockchain accounts, signatures, and transactions have an additional layer of complexity over traditional cryptographic keys and signatures.

Message included on login as a reminder, along with steps to expand the root partition to 100% of space (encrypted) SCM Hardware changes FW 01.02.02release - Supports SCM Rev B. SCM Rev B has different boot timing as compared to Rev A. This has to do with additional checks and with new requirements related to Zymbit bootware(tm). Average boots times are similar, however, some boot times may be longer by approximately 50 seconds. This is normal behavior for SCM Rev B units. SCM Rev. B has one new 40-pin connector and a different connector for tamper detect and battery backer. Please see the ECN for complete details. The new tamper/battery connector improves physical security of the SCM, improves compatibility with generic CM4 boards, and provides additional features. The new 40-pin expansion connector provides access to additional USB ports as well as additional security and integration features in future versions of the SCM. Known Issues Notice Issue Number #159 - Major Affects SCM, Firmware version: 01.02.02release (not in earlier firmware releases)\nOn B1 versions of the SCM with firmware version 01.02.02release, generated key pairs created with gen_key_pair() are removed during reboot.\nYou can determine the version with:\npython3 -c \"import zymkey; print(zymkey.client.get_firmware_version())\"\nDetails and Workaround: gen_key_pair(key_type) creates key pairs for slots 16 and up, but a reboot removes the key slots. Keys generated using the BIP32 wallet with gen_wallet_master_seed()/gen_wallet_child_key() keys are not removed on reboot. The BIP32 wallet keys can be used as a workaround for B1 units.\nFor example,\nInstead of:\nkey_slot = gen_key_pair(\"secp256k1\")\nUse:\nseed = zymkey.client.gen_wallet_master_seed(\"secp256k1\", \"\", \"wallet_name\")\nkey_slot = zymkey.client.gen_wallet_child_key(seed, 0, False)\nFrom this point on you can use the key_slot in the same manner to get_public_key(key_slot) or remove_key(key_slot)\nNotes: The problem does not affect the use of slots 0 through 15. The problem does not affect public keys stored in the Foreign key store. BIP32 wallets are hierarchical key stores, meaning removing the wallet master seed will remove all the keys in that wallet; removing a parent will remove all child slots of the parent. See BIP32 for more information. BIP32 wallets can be recovered if you setup a recovery method using either BIP39 mnemonics, or SLIP39 Shamir’s Secret Sharing of mnemonics. Zymbit supports both methods. Your particular application of keys may lend itself to different key hierarchy strategies - you could put one key in each wallet and create many wallets or put many keys in one wallet. For details on wallets, you can see https://docs.zymbit.com/tutorials/digital-wallet/ If you are creating multiple wallets, each wallet must have a unique name. This only affects SCMs with firmware 01.02.02release. This does not affect the HSM6.\nZymbit IO board: Subject to rebooting during high USB in rush current. See Engineering Note 20230721. Zymbit IO board: The ID EEPROM I2C pins are not connected. To use this feature with the Zymbit IO board, you will need two green wires to pins 27 and 28. Contact Support for more information.

Most of the problems we see are from a poor power source. Start with a good power supply from the PI foundation or Canakit, not a phone charger. The recommended power for the PI4 is 5V and 3 amps. For a PI5, the recommended power supply should provide 5V, 5 amps. I2C enabled. Double check that you have enabled the I2C bus. An easy way to check is “ls -l /dev/i2c-1”. If /dev/i2c-1 exists, the I2C bus is enabled. apt update and upgrade. Be sure that your software is up to date. Installation. The curl script will reboot your system once completed. After the reboot, the blue LED on your Zymbit device should blink once every 3 seconds. You must get to this step before proceeding to encryption, etc. If your issue is not related to any of the above list, read through the FAQ below to see if your issue is answered. If you still do not see a solution to your problem, reach out on our Community Forum. Thank you!\nQ: Why does the LED continue to blink rapidly? It never blinks with the described pattern of once (in Development mode) or three times (in Production mode) every three seconds. Expand for Answer A: Check the following:\nCheck that the Raspberry Pi power is sufficient. The red LED on most Raspberry Pi models indicates if the Pi is being powered adequately. If it is not lit at all or flashes intermittently, try a different power supply or a different USB cable.\nMake sure that you have enabled i2c support using raspi-config BEFORE your install the software. Also, when you enable i2c communications be sure to follow the enable-disable-enable sequence.\nIf i2c support has been enabled correctly and the Zymkey LED is still rapidly blinking, check proper physical installation of the Zymkey as detailed in this “Getting Started” guide.\nZymkey uses GPIO header pins 3 and 5 for i2c communications and pin 7 as an interrupt signal to the Pi. Pin 7 should preferably be dedicated exclusively to Zymkey. Other devices may share the i2c bus with Zymkey, but there may still be address conflicts. By default, Zymkey uses slave address 0x30. If the address conflict cannot be resolved on the other i2c devices, there is a way of changing the i2c address through an API call. Using this application, the Zymkey address can be changed anywhere in the ranges of 0x30-0x37 or 0x60-0x67.\nExpand for API information to change i2c address Python: set_i2c_address\nC: int zkSetI2CAddr ( zkCTX ctx, int addr)\nSee API Documentation\nOftentimes the 1-Wire interface relies on pin 7 (GPIO 4) for communication. If the 1-Wire interface is enabled, try disabling through raspi-config. If that resolves the problem take steps to either move the Zymkey interrupt signal from GPIO 4 or the 1-Wire interface from GPIO 4.\nif the directory at /var/lib/zymbit or any of the files and/or subdirectories are corrupted or deleted, the Zymkey will fail to work. IMPORTANT: if this happens when the Zymkey is locked (i.e. Production Mode), the Zymkey can never be used again.\nQ: The LED blinks rapidly when booting, but eventually turns off. It doesn’t blink once or three times every 3 seconds as described. Expand for Answer A: This issue could be caused by the same issues described in the first question (Why does the LED continue to blink rapidly?). Additionally, this can be caused if a locked (Production Mode) Zymkey is moved to another Pi.\nQ: What do the different LED blinking patterns mean? Expand for Answer 1 second very rapid flash, 1 second off, 8 slow blinks This indicates interrupted communications. 1 second very rapid flash, 1 second off, 5 slow blinks This indicates a failure to communicate with ATECC. The most likely cause is the Zymkey is in Production Mode, tamper detect was set to self-destruct, and a tamper detect event caused the Zymkey to self-destruct. If tamper detect is not armed, this indicates a hardware problem. Constant rapid blinking (waiting for host to connect) This indicates that you Zymkey is operational but has not bound to the host. If the Zymkey continues to blink this pattern, it could mean that there is a problem with the host Pi or that the i2c is not configured or that the i2c and wake pins are not making contact. Once every 3 seconds This indicates that your Zymkey is working and running. Three rapid blinks every 3 seconds This indicates the Zymkey is in Production Mode and is working and running. Rapid blinking then LED off permanently This indicates the Zymkey is in Production Mode but cannot bind with the RPi / SD card pair. In Production Mode the binding with a particular Pi and SD card becomes permanent. Most likely cause for this is that the Zymkey, the SD card, or the PI has been swapped out. Q: How do I set an alternative I2C address? Expand for Answer A: You can change the I2C address through our standard APIs:\nC: int zkSetI2CAddr ( zkCTX ctx, int addr) Python: set_i2c_address The I2C communication between the Zymkey and the Host is encrypted, but will not interfere with other devices on the same bus (assuming there is no address conflict).\nSee API Documentation\nQ: Why does my Zymkey fail to restart after cycling power? Expand for Answer A: Zymkey monitors the quality of 5V power coming into the host computer. If the voltage drops below a specified limit, even momentarily, then Zymkey will disable all security services to the host. This is a security feature to prevent power cycle and brown-own attacks. If you are powering a display, modem, or other power-hungry device from your Pi, then check the capacity and quality of your power supply. Learn more \u003e\nQ: Why is my Zymkey “invisible” to the i2c-tools suite? Expand for Answer A: Some people have become accustomed to using i2c-detect to do a first level check for correct installation and baseline functionality of i2c devices. However, these tools only really work if the i2c device communicates via a protocol that sits on top of i2c called SMBus or SMB (System Management Bus). Instead, Zymkey communicates to the host at a much more fundamental level, in part because the Zymkey protocol traffic is encrypted.\nYou can tell if you successfully installed it by observing the blue LED. If it is flashing once every 3 seconds, then binding completed. You can also use the systemctl command. It should say “active (running)”:\nsystemctl status zkifc\nQ: If the install fails, can I run it more than once? Expand for Answer A: Yes, you should have no problem running it multiple times if it were to fail.\nEncrypting Root File System Summary of steps Start with a blank USB device. USB storage should be twice the size of the SD card. The process for encrypting the SD card stops zkifc. The blue LED will flash rapidly during the encryption process. It will return to blinking once every 3 seconds when complete. The process will automatically do two reboots. Be patient. If the encryption process does not complete, it’s best to start fresh and try again. Q: How can I check if the system matches the default parameters? Expand for Answer A: lsblk will show you the partitions. Look for the name of your / partition (default is mmcblk0p2) and the USB device (default is sda). Example output:\nNAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT mmcblk0 179:0 0 14.9G 0 disk |-mmcblk0p1 179:1 0 256M 0 part /boot `-mmcblk0p2 179:2 0 14.6G 0 part / sda 8:0 0 32.0G 0 disk |_sda1 8:1 0 32.0G 0 part Q: How can I monitor the status after phase 1 reboot? Expand for Answer A: Once you get to the second phase and login, you can monitor progress with\njournalctl -fu cfg_SD_crfs\nThat will show you progress of the second half of the encryption process.\nQ: Can I re-run encryption with the same USB stick? Expand for Answer A: The script is designed to re-use information on the USB stick to encrypt a “golden” image in production on more than one device. If the file original_zk_root.tgz exists on the USB stick, it will use that file and skip the step of creating a whole new tarball of the rootfs. If you truly want to start over, start by reformatting/erasing your USB stick.\nQ: If my PI automounts the USB device, will that interfere with the process? Expand for Answer A: The script attempts to unmount the external device, but in some cricumstances the device may stay mounted and the process will fail. You will get a message either on your screen or in journalctl -fu cfg_SD_crfs during the second phase indicating the drive was already mounted. Unmount the drive and try again.\n# Check /dev/sda* mount points for devices mounted to /media/* lsblk # if mounted, unmount sudo umount /media* # re-run service sudo systemctl restart cfg_SD_crfs # monitor progress journalctl -fu cfg_SD_crfs Q: How can I confirm my file system is encrypted and protected? Expand for Answer A: Since zkifc is stopped during the process, the blue LED will flash rapidly until the whole process completes. Once both of the automautic reboots are completed, the blue LED will return to flashing once every 3 seconds.\nlsblk will show you that you now have a “cryptrfs” partition under your mmcblk0p2 (default)\ndf -h will also show “/dev/mapper/cryptrfs” for the “/” file system.\nIf your system reboots twice, the LED returns to flashing once every 3 seconds, and lsblk displays a “cryptrfs” partition, you can be confident your system is encrypted and protected.\nFor more help, see Zymbit’s Community Forum. Features Q: What curves are supported for Zymbit products? Expand for Answer Zymkey and HSM4: NIST P-256 and secp256r1\nHSM6: NIST P-256, secp256r1, secp256k1, X25519, ED25519\nQ: How do I use HSM6’s store_foreign_public_key function to store a Zymkey or HSM4 public key on HSM6? Expand for Answer A: The easiest way is to save the HSM4 key directly to a binary file, copy that file to the HSM6 and read in the binary file.\nHSM4 side:\n#!/usr/bin/python3 import zymkey # Get the public key from slot 0 and save it in a file pub_key_file = '/tmp/pub_key_slot0' slot = 0 key = zymkey.client.get_public_key(slot) with open(pub_key_file, \"wb\") as f: f.write(key) copy /tmp/pub_key_slot0 over to the HSM6 PI\nHSM6 side:\n#!/usr/bin/python3 import zymkey key_file = \"/tmp/pub_key_slot0\" key = open(key_file, \"rb\").read() # Store the key in the foreign key store foreign_slot = zymkey.client.store_foreign_public_key('secp256r1', key) Q: How can I reset the clock to the current timestamp? Expand for Answer A: The clock will sync to the current timestamp once the Pi has achieved NTP sync. This requires you to have access to the Internet.\nQ: How do I access the devices (RTC, accelerometer, crypto) on Zymkey? Expand for Answer A: For Zymkey and HSMs, kernel drivers and libraries for all of the devices are included in the Zymkey software package via the APIs.\nQ: My GPG Key expired and I cannot access the Zymkey Repository. How do I update the Key? Expand for Answer A: You can update your existing key with the following command:\ncurl -L https://zk-sw-repo.s3.amazonaws.com/apt-zymkey-pubkey.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor --yes -o /usr/share/keyrings/zymbit.gpg Q: Can the Zymkey detect if the SD card has been removed? Expand for Answer A: No, but perimeter detect can be configured to prevent access to the SD card. When a tamper event is detected, the Zymkey will, when properly configured via the API, destroy all critical key material and the root fs will fail to be decrypted upon boot.\nBattery \u0026 Power Questions Q: Should I use an external battery on my Zymkey or HSM? Expand for Answer A: The following table compares Zymkey and HSM operational modes while connected to Main Power, Battery Power, and No Power.\nThe battery is required to maintain the Real Time Clock and the perimeter detect circuits when the host power is removed. Without the battery, these two functions will not be active when the host power is removed.\nQ: What happens when the battery dies? How can I change the battery when it dies, without self-destructing my device? Expand for Answer A: If the battery dies and the host is not connected to power, some features will go out, such as Perimeter Detect and Real Time Clock. See the table below for more information.\nWith Zymkey and HSM4, if tamper detect is enabled and the battery dies or is removed, the device will self-destruct. This is an intentional security feature. If tamper detect is NOT enabled, you should connect the host device to power to change the battery.\nHSM6 has a battery monitoring feature to help the user prevent the battery from dying. If the battery dies, HSM6 users have the ability to choose whether the device should self-destruct or hold in reset mode until the battery is changed.\nKernel \u0026 Kernel Boot Questions Q: Can you tell the kernel not to run a shell? Expand for Answer A: Someone could easily replace the kernel and, while it is possible to configure initramfs to not permit the busybox shell to, that can be sidestepped as well. Even if you hack your own changes to the kernel to ignore the init option, someone could replace your kernel. Also, kernel updates would have to be done manually and the updates from the apt repo would have to be blacklisted.\nQ: Can you tell the kernel to ignore cmdline.txt? Expand for Answer A: There are many reasons why this is infeasible, but the main one is that, since the GPU initially functions as a bootloader processor during boot and since Broadcom has not made the GPU compiler publicly available as well as the source code for the bootloader, one cannot simply compile their own code that would ignore cmdline.txt.\nQ: Is it possible to encrypt the boot partition? Expand for Answer A: No because the GPU bootloader does not have encryption features implemented and, even in lieu of that, it does not know how to communicate with Zymkey. The best solution, then, would be to implement an independent secure boot procedure. As mentioned above, we are currently working on adding this feature in a future product.\nProduction (“self-destruct”) Mode Questions Q: When using the perimeter-detect feature, does the “self-destruct” mode work (destroy all of its key material) even when the Lock Tab hasn’t been cut? Expand for Answer A: Self-destruct mode works only after the Lock Tab has been cut.\nQ: Is there a way to turn off “self-destruct” mode? Expand for Answer A: No, once turned on, “self-destruct” mode is permanent.\nQ: If my Zymkey does “self-destruct,” can I create new keys and reuse the hardware? Expand for Answer The SBC and SD card hardware will be reusable. Because the SD card contents are encrypted and the decryption key was destroyed, the data is lost. The Zymkey will not be reusable because the key slots will be destroyed. Q: If I cut the Lock-Tab on a Zymkey, can I move that Zymkey to another Pi or change the SD card? Expand for Answer A: No. Cutting the Lock-Tab permanently binds that instance of Zymkey to the specific instances of host computer and SD card. This is a security feature to prevent credentials being moved from one host to another. DO NOT cut the Lock-Tab if you are still in development and expect to change the host or SD cards.\nQ: Will Zymkey still self-destruct, even when my SBC is powered off? Expand for Answer A: Yes, because Zymkey is battery powered. As long as the battery is sufficiently charged, it will still self-destruct.\nOther Q: Where can I learn about and/or pre-order future products? Expand for Answer A: Sign up for our new product email updates at the bottom of Zymbit’s homepage.\nQ: Which SBCs are compatible with Zymkey? Expand for Answer Electrically, the Zymkey-I2C will interface to any single board computer using I2C. Check compatibility with your particular Linux distribution. Raspberry Pi 3, 3B+, 4, Zero RPi Compute Module 3, 4 Q: Does Zymkey work with Arduino? Expand for Answer A: We have no plans to release an Arduino shield version. While we love Arduinos and use them all the time, they generally don’t have enough resources to handle cryptographic operations at this level.\nQ: Does Zymkey work with BeagleBone? Expand for Answer A: Zymbit does not officially support the BeagleBoard platform at this time.\nQ: Which operating systems does Zymkey support? Expand for Answer Q: How much power does Zymkey consume? Expand for Answer Zymkey-RPi (3.3V): idle approx. 1mA; max active \u003c 25mA with LED off, \u003c 35mA with LED on. Zymkey-USB (5V): idle approx. 1.5mA; max active \u003c 40mA with LEDs off, \u003c 60mA with LEDs on.

Bootware requires approximately 700MB of RAM overhead for image verification and encryption. For HTTPS endpoints, the image must be 700MB smaller than your total RAM.\nThe default SCM/SEN as shipped has Zymbit software pre-installed. For setups using the ZYMKEY4 or other Zymbit HSMs, the installation is up to the user. The Zymbit product should be up and running with the blue LED flashing once every three seconds before installing Bootware. We recommend partitioning your /boot partition with a size of 512MB (default for Bookworm). There is no need to setup encryption of your root filesystem as Bootware will do this for you.\nAn HDMI console is highly recommended for setting up your unit with Bootware. The process of repartitioning and loading takes time and the console is handy for monitoring progress.\nBootware 1.2.2 includes a new, consolidated user interface. The process of installation and configuration has changed since 1.1.\nDetails of the commands in this Quickstart are linked in-line. See the Features section for more information on how to use Bootware.\nOverview of steps to get up and running You must have the Zymbit SCM/HSM and libraries successfully installed before installing Bootware. The blue LED should blink once every three seconds.\nDownload the Bootware management tool, zbcli. Run zbcli install to install Bootware. Run zbcli imager to create and sign a Zymbit image file (zi image) of your current root file system as a backup. Run zbcli update-config to configure Partitions and Recovery strategy. For this Quickstart, we will setup A/B partitions. Run zbcli update to load a known-good example zi image into the Backup (B) partition; set B to the Active partition. Run zbcli rollback-swap to force a Rollback to your original partition to verify your A/B setup is working. 1. Download Bootware A bootstrap utility to detect and load the correct build of Bootware can be downloaded with curl:\ncurl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zymbit-applications/zb-bin/main/install.sh | sudo bash The install will identify your Pi and OS and then prompt you if you’d like to include hardware signing. The SCM and HSM6 support hardware signing. All Zymbit products support software signing. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use software signing.

Once completed, all necessary files required for loading new images via Bootware will be installed.\n3. Run zbcli imager to create a Bootware-ready Zymbit Image backup (zi image) Bootware requires images in a secure, signed format for loading with zboot. We refer to these images as “zi images.” An image conversion tool, zbcli imager, creates the zi image. zbcli imager can take a snapshot of your running system or read from tarballs of your bootfs and rootfs partitions. Images can also be partial file additions and deletions called Overlay images.\nIf you are Developing on a CM4 directly and need to transition to an SCM, See Developing on the CM4 for instructions on how to create an image from your CM4 to load onto the SCM.\nCreate a zi image backup from your current running root file system Use zbcli imager to create a zi image backup of your current system. Once created, the zi image can be propagated to other disk partitions securely. A private/public key pair will be used for signing the zi image at time of creation and verifying during the update process. Key pairs can either be created in software or using the Zymbit HSM hardware. For this Quickstart, we will use software keys. Details on signing and verifying can be found here.\nIn this guide, we will output the image directly to a USB stick. Mount the USB stick for access,\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt Start the imager module of zbcli. We will run interactively. You can also run non-interactively by supplying all necessary parameters on the command line. See zbcli imager for details.\nAll necessary information will be prompted for starting with the output directory and the name of the image file. The output directory will be excluded from the image. A .zi extension will be added to the image name provided.\nsudo zbcli imager Validated bootware installation --------- Pi Module Raspberry Pi 4 Operating System Rpi-Bookworm Zymbit module Secure Compute Module Kernel kernel8.img --------- Cleaned '/etc/zymbit/zboot/update_artifacts/tmp' ✔ Enter output directory · /mnt ✔ Enter image name · my_image Next, you will be prompted for what type of image to make: A full image of the live system or an Overlay image from files added with zbcli manifest. An Overlay image can be used to add, replace, or delete a select group of files for updates, patches, etc. For this example, we will create a complete image from the running system. Select the Full Image option.\n? Select image type › ❯ Full image of live system Overlay image from files added with zbcli manifest You can optionally provide an image version. This is for your use in helping to identify the image later. It is not used in the process.\nNext, you will be prompted for signing keys. Keys can be Software or Hardware based and are used for signing and verification of images. Software keys are supported on all Zymbit products. Hardware keys are supported with Secure Compute Module (SCM) or HSM6 products. Had we chosen earlier to include hardware key support, we would be asked to choose either hardware or software key support. We chose earlier to not include hardware key support. You can use an existing key or instruct the imager to create new ones for you. For this Quickstart, we will generate a new Software key. Select Create new software key\n?

Run zbcli update-config to configure the Partitioning and Image loading Now we will use the zi image and public key we just created to configure an A/B partition and load the image into the BACKUP (B) partition.\nFirst, copy the public key file created earlier by the imager from /dev/sda1 to a location on your local filesystem.\ncp /mnt/my_image_pub_key.pem . Use the Bootware zbcli update-config to Configure your System Bootware includes a tool to help configure your system called zbcli update-config. zbcli update-config is meant to setup your device environment to load a zi image from a configured endpoint, as well as choose an update policy for how to apply zi images. More information on zbcli update-config can be found here. Navigate through the menus with up and down arrows. Use ENTER to make a choice. Each configuration option will display the available options with explanations.\nWe are going to set a configuration with A/B partitioning that will UPDATE the BACKUP, leaving the A partition as the stable partition for fallback.\nNotice The A and B partitions will roughly split the disk space available. If your current partition size exceeds half of the total disk size, the update mode will be switched to UPDATE_BOTH, and your zi image will be loaded into both the A and B partitions. You will be notified that your UPDATE mode has switched from UPDATE_BACKUP to UPDATE_BOTH. After the update has been applied to the A \u0026 B partitions, you can then switch to UPDATE_BACKUP via zbcli update-config. sudo zbcli update-config Validated bootware installation --------- Pi Module Raspberry Pi 4 Operating System Rpi-Bookworm Zymbit module Secure Compute Module Kernel kernel8.img --------- ❯ Configure partition layout Configure update policy Configure update endpoint Configure wireless network Revert to default configuration Save and exit Choose your settings as described below.\nFor Configure partition layout, choose [RECOMMENDED] A/B:\n❯ [RECOMMENDED] A/B: This will take the remaining disk space available after the boot partition and create two encrypted partitions, each taking up half of the remaining space. Most useful for rollback and recovery with an Active/Backup configuration. For Configure update policy, choose [RECOMMENDED] BACKUP:\n❯ [RECOMMENDED] BACKUP: Applies new updates to current backup filesystem and swap to booting the new updated backup partition as the active partition now. If the new update is bad, it will rollback into the previous stable active partition. For Configure data partition size in MB, choose the size of the encrypted shared DATA partition.

If not correct, enter no to exit. You may then re-run zbcli update-config to correct the configuration. If the configuration is not valid, zbcli update will exit.\nNext, you need to enter the path to your public key file (in PEM format). For this example, we will use the public key file we copied locally earlier.\n✔ Enter public key file (Pem format) · ./my_image_pub_key.pem If verification with the Public Key succeeds, zbcli update will continue with progress information, then prompt for a reboot to complete the process.\nBootware Boot Process The Bootware update process will now take place. Upon reboot in UPDATE_BACKUP mode, zboot will allocate, create, and encrypt a B partition, then load the contents of your zi image onto it. The A partition will remain untouched, and the system will come back online with partition B (cryptrfs_B) as its root filesystem.\nIf your original partition was more than half the available disk space and you were switched to UPDATE_BOTH during configuration, both A and B will have been created and your image loaded into both. In this case, the system will come back online after the update with its root filesystem on partition A (cryptrfs_A).\nNotice The initial configuration process can take 30 to 60 minutes to complete depending on the size of the image. The setup process with zbcli can be completed via SSH, but an HDMI console is helpful to follow the progress from within zboot. The Zymkey’s blue LED will return to flashing once every three seconds once the update process completes and the linux system has come back online. On the console, you will see:\n“Loading: Encrypted zboot please wait…” message, which takes around 4-5min. The A/B partitions will be configured and setup for LUKS encryption protected by the Zymbit HSM. It will then take a few minutes to process and validate the image. Depending on the size of the zi image, it may take a significant amount of time to load its contents into the root partition(s) being targeted for update. Once zboot is done unpacking the image to the B partition, it will boot your system with the B (UPDATE_BACKUP mode) / A (UPDATE_BOTH mode) partition as the ACTIVE partition. You can use lsblk to examine the partition layout. 4. Quickcheck: Manual Rollback (Active/Backup partitions) To verify you now have two valid partitions, manually trigger a rollover from Active to Backup with zbcli rollback-swap. This will reboot your system into its non-active root partition. No update process will be invoked and the contents of both partitions will remain enchanged.\nsudo zbcli rollback-swap Once again, you can use lsblk to verify the active partition has changed. You should now have identical Active and Backup partitions with working images ready for your development.\nIf Bootware detects that the system has failed to reach a systemd init target for 3 consecutive attempts in a row, it will automatically initiate a rollback-swap of the root partitions upon the next reboot.\nAdditional Information and Support zbcli commands\nContact Support\n","categories":"","description":"Getting Started tutorial to get Bootware up and running","excerpt":"Getting Started tutorial to get Bootware up and running","ref":"/bootware1.3.2/archive/bootware1.2.2/getting-started/","tags":"","title":"Getting Started: Bootware 1.2.2"},{"body":"Quickstart - Download, Install, and Configure Bootware In this Getting Started guide we describe how to bring up a common use case for Bootware - A/B partitioning for fallback and recovery.\nResources Step-by-step videos of this Getting-Started are also available.

Once completed, all necessary files required for loading new images via Bootware will be installed.\n3. Run zbcli imager to create a Bootware-ready Zymbit Image backup (zi image) Bootware requires images in a secure, signed format for loading with zboot. We refer to these images as “zi images.” An image conversion tool, zbcli imager, creates the zi image. zbcli imager can take a snapshot of your running system or read from tarballs of your bootfs and rootfs partitions. Images can also be partial file additions and deletions called Overlay images.\nIf you are Developing on a CM4 directly and need to transition to an SCM, See Developing on the CM4 for instructions on how to create an image from your CM4 to load onto the SCM.\nCreate a zi image backup from your current running root file system Use zbcli imager to create a zi image backup of your current system. Once created, the zi image can be propagated to other disk partitions securely. A private/public key pair will be used for signing the zi image at time of creation and verifying during the update process. Key pairs can either be created in software or using the Zymbit HSM hardware. For this Quickstart, we will use software keys. Details on signing and verifying can be found here.\nIn this guide, we will output the image directly to a USB stick. Mount the USB stick for access,\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt Start the imager module of zbcli. We will run interactively. You can also run non-interactively by supplying all necessary parameters on the command line. See zbcli imager for details.\nAll necessary information will be prompted for starting with the output directory and the name of the image file. The output directory will be excluded from the image. A .zi extension will be added to the image name provided.\nsudo zbcli imager Validated bootware installation --------- Pi Module Raspberry Pi 4 Operating System Rpi-Bookworm Zymbit module Secure Compute Module Kernel kernel8.img --------- Cleaned '/etc/zymbit/zboot/update_artifacts/tmp' ✔ Enter output directory · /mnt ✔ Enter image name · my_image Next, you will be prompted for what type of image to make: A full image of the live system or an Overlay image from files added with zbcli manifest.

Hardware keys are supported with Secure Compute Module (SCM) or HSM6 products. Had we chosen earlier to include hardware key support, we would be asked to choose either hardware or software key support. We chose earlier to not include hardware key support. You can use an existing key or instruct the imager to create new ones for you. For this Quickstart, we will generate a new software key. Select Create new software key\n?

Bootware requires approximately 700MB of RAM overhead for image verification and encryption. For HTTPS endpoints, the image must be 700MB smaller than your total RAM. For A/B partitioning, it is recommended to use at least 16GB for storage space.\nThe default SCM/SEN as shipped has Zymbit Driver Package pre-installed. For setups using the ZYMKEY4 or other Zymbit HSMs, the installation is up to the user. The Zymbit product should be up and running with the blue LED flashing once every three seconds before installing Bootware. We recommend partitioning your /boot partition with a size of 512MB (default for Bookworm). The standard Zymbit encrytion process is not necessary as Bootware will do this for you.\nA free ZYMKEY is available when you sign up for a Bootware trial. See Get Bootware\nAn HDMI console is highly recommended for setting up your unit with Bootware. The process of repartitioning and loading takes time and the console is handy for monitoring progress.\nBootware 1.3.x includes the same, consolidated user interface introduced in 1.2. The process of installation and configuration has changed since 1.1.\nDetails of the commands in this Quickstart are linked in-line.

Once completed, all necessary files required for loading new images via Bootware will be installed.\n3. Run zbcli imager to create a Bootware-ready Zymbit Image backup (zi image) Bootware requires images in a secure, signed format for loading with zboot. We refer to these images as “zi images.” An image conversion tool, zbcli imager, creates the zi image. zbcli imager can take a snapshot of your running system or read from tarballs of your bootfs and rootfs partitions. Images can also be partial file additions and deletions called Overlay images.\nIf you are Developing on a CM4 directly and need to transition to an SCM, See Developing on the CM4 for instructions on how to create an image from your CM4 to load onto the SCM.\nCreate a zi image backup from your current running root file system Use zbcli imager to create a zi image backup of your current system. Once created, the zi image can be propagated to other disk partitions securely. A private/public key pair will be used for signing the zi image at time of creation and verifying during the update process. Key pairs can either be created in software or using the Zymbit HSM hardware. For this Quickstart, we will use software keys. Details on signing and verifying can be found here.\nIn this guide, we will output the image directly to a USB stick. Mount the USB stick for access,\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt Start the imager module of zbcli. We will run interactively. You can also run non-interactively by supplying all necessary parameters on the command line. See zbcli imager for details.\nAll necessary information will be prompted for starting with the output directory and the name of the image file. The output directory will be excluded from the image. A .zi extension will be added to the image name provided.\nsudo zbcli imager Validated bootware installation --------- Pi Module Raspberry Pi 4 Operating System Rpi-Bookworm Zymbit module Secure Compute Module Kernel kernel8.img --------- Cleaned '/etc/zymbit/zboot/update_artifacts/tmp' ✔ Enter output directory · /mnt ✔ Enter image name · my_image Next, you will be prompted for what type of image to make: A full image of the live system or an Overlay image from files added with zbcli manifest. An Overlay image can be used to add, replace, or delete a select group of files for updates, patches, etc. For this example, we will create a complete image from the running system. Select the Full Image option.\n? Select image type › ❯ Full image of live system Overlay image from files added with zbcli manifest You can optionally provide an image version. This is for your use in helping to identify the image later. It is not used in the process.\nNext, you will be prompted for signing keys. Keys can be software or hardware based and are used for signing and verification of images. Software keys are supported on all Zymbit products. Hardware keys are supported with Secure Compute Module (SCM) or HSM6 products. Had we chosen earlier to include hardware key support, we would be asked to choose either hardware or software key support. We chose earlier to not include hardware key support. You can use an existing key or instruct the imager to create new ones for you. For this Quickstart, we will generate a new software key. Select Create new software key\n?

Run zbcli update-config to configure the Partitioning and Image loading Now we will use the zi image and public key we just created to configure an A/B partition and load the image into the BACKUP (B) partition.\nFirst, copy the public key file created earlier by the imager from /dev/sda1 to a location on your local filesystem.\ncp /mnt/my_image_pub_key.pem . Use the Bootware zbcli update-config to Configure your System Bootware includes a tool to help configure your system called zbcli update-config. zbcli update-config is meant to setup your device environment to load a zi image from a configured endpoint, as well as choose an update policy for how to apply zi images. More information on zbcli update-config can be found here. Navigate through the menus with up and down arrows. Use ENTER to make a choice. Each configuration option will display the available options with explanations.\nWe are going to set a configuration with A/B partitioning that will UPDATE the BACKUP, leaving the A partition as the stable partition for fallback.\nNotice The A and B partitions will roughly split the disk space available, minus a common data partition size that you specify. If your current partition size exceeds half of the total disk size, the update mode will be switched to UPDATE_BOTH, and your zi image will be loaded into both the A and B partitions. You will be notified that your UPDATE mode has switched from UPDATE_BACKUP to UPDATE_BOTH. After the update has been applied to the A \u0026 B partitions, you can then switch to UPDATE_BACKUP via zbcli update-config. sudo zbcli update-config Validated bootware installation --------- Pi Module Raspberry Pi 4 Operating System Rpi-Bookworm Zymbit module Secure Compute Module Kernel kernel8.img --------- ❯ Configure partition layout Configure update policy Configure data partition size in MB. Does not apply if there is an existing data partition. Configure update endpoint Configure wireless network manually with a ssid / psk Configure wireless network automatically with a wpa supplicant conf file Configure hostname for post-update Configure password for post-update Save and exit Choose your settings as described below.\nFor Configure partition layout, choose [RECOMMENDED] A/B:\n❯ [RECOMMENDED] A/B: This will take the remaining disk space available after the boot partition and create two encrypted partitions, each taking up half of the remaining space. Most useful for rollback and recovery with an Active/Backup configuration. For Configure update policy, choose [RECOMMENDED] BACKUP:\n❯ [RECOMMENDED] BACKUP: Applies new updates to current backup filesystem and swap to booting the new updated backup partition as the active partition now. If the new update is bad, it will rollback into the previous stable active partition. NOTE: If the existing root partition is too big to create a new backup partition, the update policy will be switched to BOTH. A WARNING! will be issued:\nActive partition won't be saved!!! Changing update mode to UPDATE_BOTH!!! Using update mode (UPDATE_BOTH) For Configure data partition size in MB, choose the size of the encrypted shared DATA partition. You can choose a size in Megabytes that you prefer. The default is 512MB. Note: If the partition exists, this option is ignored.\n? Enter size of data partition in MB › 1024 For Configure update endpoint, choose the block device or URL endpoint that holds your zi image file. Note: You must complete this step as the endpoint will be validated.\nUsing update endpoint '/dev/sda1' Defaulting to configured endpoint '/dev/sda1' Info update endpoints can be either an HTTPS URL or an external mass storage device like a USB stick. ? Enter update endpoint › /dev/sda1 zbcli update-config will confirm the endpoint is reachable, and set the update image name found at the endpoint. If multiple images are found, a menu of available images is presented to choose from.\nConfigure wireless network manually with a ssid / psk - Along with local devices, such as a USB stick, Bootware supports pulling remote updates via Wi-Fi or LAN connections. Bootware Wi-Fi credentials are separate from the standard userspace Wi-fi credentials. Wi-Fi credentials need to be provided in order for bootware to access the wifi during updates. If no wireless credentials are provided, the wireless interface is disabled in zboot. Here, you can simply supply your SSID and password. If you need to supply additional Wi-Fi security, the next option allows you to supply credentials in a standard, wpa_supplicant.conf format.\nConfigure wireless network automatically with a wpa supplicant conf file - Bootware/zboot contains a functional wpa_supplicant implementation. This option allows the user to point to a standard wpa_supplicant.conf file in userspace that will be imported into Bootware directly. Use this option if your setup requires certificate-based authentication, or other more complicated setups.\nConfigure hostname for post-update - A post-update process is included to change your hostname to the specified name. This will be done for every future update until cleared or changed.\nConfigure password for post-update - A post-update process is included to change the password for a specified user. This will be done for every future update until cleared or changed.\nSave and exit to save and exit zbcli update-config. You can Ctrl-C at any point before saving to exit the configurator without applying any changes.\n5. Run zbcli update to create the Backup partition and load the zi image. Once you are satisfied with your Bootware configuration, run zbcli update to complete the process of repartitioning and loading your image.\nsudo zbcli update Validated bootware installation --------- Pi Module: Raspberry Pi 4 Operating System: Rpi-Bookworm Zymbit module: Zymkey Kernel: kernel8.img --------- Cleaned '/etc/zymbit/zboot/update_artifacts/tmp' Found update configs ?

These can be modified through 'zbcli update-config' --------- Update endpoint /dev/sda1 Update name my_image Endpoint type LOCAL Partition layout A/B Data partition 1024MB Update policy UPDATE_BOTH Hostname Not set Password Not set --------- (y/n) › yes The script will show your configuration for review and confirmation and give you the option to change the configuration. If not correct, enter no to exit. You may then re-run zbcli update-config to correct the configuration. If the configuration is not valid, zbcli update will exit.\nNext, you need to enter the path to your public key file (in PEM format). For this example, we will use the public key file we copied locally earlier.\n✔ Enter public key file (Pem format) · ./my_image_pub_key.pem If verification with the Public Key succeeds, zbcli update will continue with progress information, then prompt for a reboot to complete the process.\nBootware Boot Process The Bootware update process will now take place. Upon reboot in UPDATE_BACKUP mode, zboot will allocate, create, and encrypt a B partition, then load the contents of your zi image onto it. If there was sufficient space to create the B partition, the A partition will remain untouched, and the system will come back online with partition B (cryptrfs_B) as its root filesystem.\nIf your original partition was more than half the available disk space and you were switched to UPDATE_BOTH during configuration, both A and B will have been created and your image loaded into both. In this case, the system will come back online after the update with its root filesystem on partition A (cryptrfs_A).\nWhile the Bootware update process takes place, a Bootware splash screen is displayed on the console, along with a progress bar.\nOn the console, you will see:\nBootware will process and validate the image. The A/B partitions will be configured and setup for LUKS encryption protected by the Zymbit HSM. Depending on the size of the zi image, it may take a significant amount of time to load its contents into the root partition(s) being targeted for update. Once zboot is done unpacking the image to the B partition, it will boot your system with the B (UPDATE_BACKUP mode) / A (UPDATE_BOTH mode) partition as the ACTIVE partition. Notice The initial configuration process can take 30 to 60 minutes to complete depending on the size of the image. The setup process with zbcli can be completed via SSH, but an HDMI console is helpful to follow the progress from within zboot. The Zymkey’s blue LED will return to flashing once every three seconds once the update process completes and the linux system has come back online. You can use lsblk to examine the partition layout.\nWith B ACTIVE,\n$ lsblk NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS sda 8:0 1 57.7G 0 disk └─sda1 8:1 1 57.7G 0 part mmcblk0 179:0 0 14.8G 0 disk ├─mmcblk0p1 179:1 0 512M 0 part /boot/firmware ├─mmcblk0p2 179:2 0 6.7G 0 part ├─mmcblk0p3 179:3 0 6.7G 0 part │ └─cryptrfs_B 254:0 0 6.7G 0 crypt / (B ACTIVE) └─mmcblk0p4 179:4 0 1G 0 part └─cryptrfs_DATA 254:1 0 1008M 0 crypt With A ACTIVE,\n$ lsblk NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS sda 8:0 1 57.7G 0 disk └─sda1 8:1 1 57.7G 0 part mmcblk0 179:0 0 14.8G 0 disk ├─mmcblk0p1 179:1 0 512M 0 part /boot/firmware ├─mmcblk0p2 179:2 0 6.7G 0 part │ └─cryptrfs_A 254:0 0 6.7G 0 crypt / (A ACTIVE) ├─mmcblk0p3 179:3 0 6.7G 0 part └─mmcblk0p4 179:4 0 1G 0 part └─cryptrfs_DATA 254:1 0 1008M 0 crypt 4. Quickcheck: Manual Rollback (Active/Backup partitions) To verify you now have two valid partitions, manually trigger a rollover from Active to Backup with zbcli rollback-swap. This will reboot your system into its non-active root partition. No update process will be invoked and the contents of both partitions will remain enchanged.\nsudo zbcli rollback-swap Once again, you can use lsblk to verify the active partition has changed. You should now have identical Active and Backup partitions with working images ready for your development.\nIf Bootware detects that the system has failed to reach a systemd init target for 3 consecutive attempts in a row, it will automatically initiate a rollback-swap of the root partitions upon the next reboot.\nAdditional Information and Support zbcli commands\nContact Support\nFor Bootware to use Wi-Fi to retrieve images from remote endpoints on Pi4/CM4 running either Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy) or Bullseye, you must use the latest dtb file, available here:. ↩︎ ↩︎ ↩︎ ↩︎\nTo install Bootware on a PiZero2W running Bullseye64, you need to update the boot artifacts prior to installation.

The root file system will be re-partitioned with your chosen configuration. Filesystem sizes estimates are based off of 32GB CM4s. Choose the recommended Option 3 A/B.\n3 A/B – RECOMMENDED This will take the remaining disk space available after the boot partition and create two encrypted partitions, each taking up half of the remaining space (around 14.4 GB). Update Policy – The update policies define if image updates are applied to the Backup, Active, or Both partitions. Choose the recommended Option 1 - Backup. This way you know you have a good Active partition for fallback.\nEndpoint Setup – The configured endpoint with image. The endpoint can be either an HTTPS URL or a local external mass storage device like a USB stick or nVME drive. We are going to use the URL of our known good image:\nFor bullseye,\nhttps:///bootware.s3.amazonaws.com/zymbit_bullseye64_1.1 For bookworm,\nhttps:///bootware.s3.amazonaws.com/zymbit_bookworm64_1.1 For ubuntu,\nhttps:///bootware.s3.amazonaws.com/zymbit_ubuntu64_22.04_1.1 If you opted to download one of the zi images to a local device, enter the device endpoint name instead.\n/dev/sda1 zb-wizard will attempt to verify the zi image is reachable.\nWireless Setup – Bootware supports pulling updates via Wifi or LAN connections. Wifi credentials need to be provided in order for bootware to access the wifi during updates. If no wireless credentials are provided, the wireless interface is disabled in zboot.\nSave and Exit to exit zb-wizard.\n4. Run zb-update to create the Backup partition and load the zi image. Once you have completed using the Wizard to configure your Bootware, run zb-update to complete the process of repartitioning and loading your image.\nsudo zb-update The script will show your configuration for review and confirmation and give you the option to change the configuration.\nParameter Setting Notes update_endpoint https://bootware.s3.amazonaws.com/zymbit_bullseye64_1.1 or the endpoint for bookworm or ubuntu from above endpoint_type HTTPS if you are using a local endpoint, adjust, e.g. /dev/sda1 one_root_fs false We are using A/B: two root partitions update_mode UPDATE_BACKUP We are only going to load the image onto the BACKUP partition resize_a false We are not going to make one big A partition. We are making an A and B Hit return or Y to start the download process.\nOnce completed, zb-update will ask you to confirm the name of the image, and the verification public key information. For this example, that will be the software-based public key PEM file downloaded earlier.\nParameter Setting Notes Use software-based keys for verifying Y Use software keys Existing key path? pub_key_1.1.pem Adjust if not downloaded to your local directory The script will prompt for a reboot to complete the process.\nzboot Boot Process The Bootware boot process will now take place. zboot will boot your system. Upon reboot, an encrypted B partition will be created and the zi image will be loaded onto B. The A partition will remain untouched.\nWarning The initial configuration process can take up to an hour to complete, depending on the size of the image. The process can be completed via ssh, but an HDMI console is helpful to follow the process. During the process, the blue LED will be OFF. On the console, you will see:\n“Loading: Encrypted zboot please wait…” message, which takes around 4-5min. The B partitions will be configured and setup for LUKS encryption protected by the Zymbit SCM It will then take a few minutes to get/unpack tarballs from the image, and verify the signature It will take some time to unpack the image into the B root partition, depending on the size of the image. Once it’s done unpacking the image to the B partition, it will boot into the B partition as the ACTIVE partition. You can use lsblk to examine the partitions. 4. Quickcheck - Force Failover (Change Active/Backup partitions) To verify you now have your A partition intact, force a failover from Active to Backup with the -r option to zb-update\nsudo zb-update -r You should now have Active and Backup partitions with working images ready for your development.\nAdditional Information and Support Contact Support\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Quickstart - Download and Install Bootware Software In this Getting …","ref":"/bootware1.3.2/archive/bootware-one-zero-general/getting-started/","tags":"","title":"Bootware 1.0-general Getting Started"},{"body":" Bootware applies updates through zymbit images or *.zi files. These files are created by using the zb-imager tool to package up a zymbit image for the user. These images can be signed by either hardware keys stored in the HSM or with software key files generated by the ecdsa library. zb-imager will generate both the hardware keys and the software keys based off of SECP256k1.\nHardware key generation: Zb-imager leverages the BIP32/BIP39 wallet APIs of the SCM for key generation. The wallet is named “bootware” and will generate the signing key pair with the wallet address of “m/0/n” (where n is a random number between 0-100). The wallet address “m/0/n” info will be stored in the zymbit image: header.txt. After the zb-imager finishes signing the image with the signing key, the tool will say what slot the “m/0/n” key is residing in, as well as prompt the user for saving the bip39 mnemonic to file. The BIP39 mnemonic is a 24 word sentence that can be used to regenerate the master keypair or “m” of the wallet. So this is one way to re-clone the same hardware generated key between different publishing nodes. To verify the image on the node that needs to apply the update, zb-update will ask for an existing key slot number to verify with.\nThe best way to transport the key over from the publishing node to the receiving node:\nOn the publishing node:\n#Save this public_key to a file public_key = zymkey.client.get_public_key(signing_key_slot_number) On the receiving node:\n#Store the public key in the HSM to verify updates with foreign_key_slot = zymkey.client.store_foreign_public_key(\"secp256k1\", public_key) Using zb-update on receiving node:\nsudo zb-update --key-slot=foreign_key_slot Software key generation: Zb-imager leverages the python ecdsa library to generate a SECP256K1 key pair as private_key.pem/pub_key.pem. These key files will be saved to the same location as the image that is being created. Both the zb-imager and zb-update tools will take in a filepath to these key files when the user specifies software keys for signing/verifying.\nWarning: If using the “LOCAL DEVICE” configuration of zb-update. Do not use a file path that points at a pub_key.pem on the local device. Zb-update will remount the local device on /etc/zymbit/zboot/mnt so the filepath will change.\nUsing zb-update on receiving node:\nsudo zb-update --key-file=/home/zymbit/pub_key.pem See also: zb-imager\nzb-update\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Bootware applies updates through zymbit images or *.zi files.

Zymbit’s Hardware Wallet conforms to BIP32, BIP39, BIP44 documents for Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets. An HD wallet derives all new addresses/keys from a master seed, thus creating a hierarchical wallet structure. BIP32 is the first seed standard for HD wallets, while BIP39 is a standard that converts a mnemonic sentence (a sentence of random words) into a 512 bit seed used for Master Seed recovery. BIP44 allows for multiple accounts in the form of children derivations from the master seed.\nA Hardware Wallet, or cold storage wallet, allows you to connect online and access your digital assets, and then safely store the referenced asset in the hardware wallet. The asset does not need to be stored on online servers or platforms. The private keys of the Hardware wallet remain on the device and are never exposed.\nA Software Wallet, also known as a Soft Wallet or Desktop Wallet locally stores your keys on your desktop or in some other online location. The disadvantage of a Soft Wallet is that the presence of the keys online makes them far more susceptible to attacks.\nWhat is the Zymbit Embedded Hardware Wallet? Zymbit Embedded Hardware Wallet functionality is available in Zymbit products, HSM6 and SCM. These products are designed to easily integrate into IoT and blockchain appliances that manage large numbers of keys and/or participate in blockchain and crypto transactions.\nThe core features of Zymbit Embedded Hardware Wallets are:\nBIP32 – Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet BIP39 – Master Seed Mnemonic Code Generator BIP44 – Multi-Account Hierarchy Support SLIP39 – Shamirs Secret Sharing See example APIs for secure easy integration with host computer (Python, C, C++) Dedicated secure hardware with tamper protection and response. Why use a Hardware Wallet? To make secure crypto transactions, a user needs to have a public/private key pair. The public key is an address used for receiving incoming goods, while the private key is used for sending those goods. Losing this key pair will be disastrous, as this will effectively give someone access to the assets in that key pair. This is why for additional security it’s best practice to change addresses (keys) for every transaction. HD wallets automatically derive new addresses to use, thus eliminating the problem for the user to generate hundreds of keys on their own.\nManaging your Hardware Wallet and Security Awareness The master seed is where all new key pairs will be derived from. Each new child key pair is created based off a existing parent key pair in the wallet. If a child key pair ever becomes ‘compromised’, it can’t be tracked up the parent nodes. However this does warrant security awareness, that it will compromise all children key pairs derived from the stolen key pair.\nWarning For security reasons, the user is expected to keep track of all the key pairs via either the node address on the wallet or the slot it was allocated to on the Zymbit module. It’s better to lose a branch than a whole tree, so keep your master seed safe and locked away! Prerequisites Zymbit Modules that support this feature:\nHSM6 SCM Follow the Getting Started guide first, installing all Zymbit Driver Package.\nAll code snippets written in this article are written using python3. For more Zymbit API documentation (Python/C/C++) visit: API Documentation\nUsing the Zymbit Hardware Wallet: Example code snippet to show how to use the Zymbit wallet API\n#!/usr/bin/python3 import zymkey # Create a master seed and return the BIP39 mnemonic master_key_generator = bytearray(\"3xampleM@sterK3Y\", 'utf-8') wallet_name = \"MyExampleWallet\" # Use the BIP39 recovery strategy to tell zymkey to return a mnemonic.

Can be empty string. use_BIP39_recovery = zymkey.RecoveryStrategyBIP39() master_slot, BIP39_mnemonic = zymkey.client.gen_wallet_master_seed(\"secp256k1\", master_key_generator, wallet_name, use_BIP39_recovery) print(\"Master Slot:%s\\nBIP39 mnemonic (write this down!):\\n%s\" % (master_slot, BIP39_mnemonic)) # Generate a child key from the master seed child_slot = zymkey.client.gen_wallet_child_key(master_slot, 3, True) child_pub_key = zymkey.client.get_public_key(child_slot) print(\"Child Slot:%s\\nChild Public Key:%s\" % (child_slot, child_pub_key)) # Get node address of the child key slot node_addr = zymkey.client.get_wallet_node_addr(child_slot) print(\"Node index:'%s' Wallet Name:'%s' Master Slot:'%s'\" % (node_addr[0], node_addr[1], node_addr[2])) # Get the key slot of the child key using our previous master key slot and wallet name key_slot = zymkey.client.get_wallet_key_slot(node_addr[0],wallet_name, master_slot) print(\"Key Slot:%s\" % (key_slot,)) # Remove the master seed zymkey.client.remove_key(master_slot) # Restore the master seed with our previous written down BIP39 mnemonic! restored_seed_slot = zymkey.client.restore_wallet_master_seed(\"secp256k1\", bytearray(\"3xampleM@sterK3Y\", 'utf-8'), wallet_name, use_BIP39_recovery, BIP39_mnemonic) print(\"Restored slot:%s\" % (restored_seed_slot,)) # Clean up the example slots zymkey.client.remove_key(master_slot) zymkey.client.remove_key(child_slot) Creating a master seed (new wallet) The Zymbit module with wallet support can have multiple master seeds be stored in its key store, allowing for management of a variety of keyrings to work with. Master seeds and its derivations are additionally backed by EC curve cryptography for an extra layer of encryption/security. The ec curves currently supported are nistp256, secp256r1, secp256k1. The master_key_generator is used to generate the BIP32 master seed, can be empty string. The RecoveryStrategy parameter dictates what recovery algorithm to return when generating the master seed. If the base RecoveryStrategy is used or none is specified, then no mnemonic will be returned. Current supported recovery strategies are none, BIP39. This example generates a master seed with the RecoveryStrategyBIP39. The BIP39 mnemonic is a 24 word string that can be used to restore or recreate a previous generated master seed. Note that a wallet name is also unique! There can not be multiple wallets with the same name.\nWarning Make sure to write the BIP39 mnemonic and store it somewhere safe! The master seed is the key to its kingdom. Don’t give it out to just anybody! The function gen_wallet_master_seed returns the allocated master seed slot and the BIP39 mnemonic if the bool flag is set True\n# Create a master seed and return the BIP39 mnemonic master_key_generator = bytearray(\"3xampleM@sterK3Y\", 'utf-8') wallet_name = \"MyExampleWallet\" # Use the BIP39 recovery strategy to tell zymkey to return a mnemonic.

BIP32 has two possible derivations hardened and non-hardened. Non-hardened key pairs can be linked back to its parent key pair with just its public key. Hardened key pairs cannot be linked back to its parent key. So for best security practices, it’s advised to generate hardened key pairs wherever possible.\nThe function gen_wallet_child_key returns allocated slot on success.\n# Generate a child key from the master seed child_slot = zymkey.client.gen_wallet_child_key(master_slot, 3, True) child_pub_key = zymkey.client.get_public_key(child_slot) print(\"Child Slot:%s\\nChild Public Key:%s\" % (child_slot, child_pub_key)) Node Address: The index parameter in the above example will add a new number 3 to the node address string in the wallet. Apostrophes after the number denote hardened keys. Below is an example node address string.\nm / 3' / 1' / 0' / 1 / 28\nGet a node address from a key slot If the user knows the key slot, they can get the node index and wallet name with this function.\nThe function get_wallet_node_addr(int slot) returns an array [node index string, wallet name, master seed slot number].\n# Get node address of the child key slot node_addr = zymkey.client.get_wallet_node_addr(child_slot) print(\"Node address:'%s' Wallet Name:'%s' Master Slot:'%s'\" % (node_addr[0], node_addr[1], node_addr[2])) Get a key slot from a wallet node address If the user knows the wallet node index string and either the master seed slot or the wallet name it belongs to, they can get the key slot with this function. Both master seed slot and wallet name are optional arguments, but if neither are filled, then it will throw an exception.\nThe function get_wallet_key_slot(string node_index, string wallet_name, int master_slot) returns the key slot on success.\n# Get the key slot of the child key using our previous master key slot and wallet name key_slot = zymkey.client.get_wallet_key_slot(node_addr[0],\"MyExampleWallet\", master_slot) print(\"Key Slot:%s\" % (key_slot,)) Restore a wallet master seed from a BIP39 mnemonic With the BIP39 mnemonic sentence, BIP39 passphrase, master generatorkey, and wallet name of a previously generated master seed, a user can restore a lost master seed or make a copy of the master seed on a different device.\nWarning Keep in mind that this only restores the master seed.

Filesystem sizes estimates are based off of 32GB CM4s.\n1 A Only [HALF DISK] – This will take the remaining disk space available after the boot partition and create an encrypted partition that will use half of this space as the root partition (around 14.4 GB). This leaves half the disk empty on purpose for dev usage.\n2 A only [FULL DISK] – This will take the remaining disk space available after the boot partition (around ~29GB) and create an encrypted partition that will use almost all of this space as the root partition.\n3 A/B – RECOMMENDED This will take the remaining disk space available after the boot partition and create two encrypted partitions, each taking up half of the remaining space (around 14.4 GB). Most useful for rollback and recovery with an Active/Backup configuration.\nUpdate Policy – The update policies are centered around how a new update gets applied to the filesystems on the device. The update policies listed below are only related to (A)ctive/(B)ackup partitioned devices, as (A)ctive only devices only have one filesystem to update.\n1 Backup – RECOMMENDED Apply new updates to current backup filesystem and swap to booting the new updated backup partition as the active partition now. If the new update is bad, it will rollback into the previous stable active partition. Only relevant when configured with A/B partitions.\n2 Active – Apply new updates to only the current active filesystem. If the backup filesystem exists, keep the backup filesystem untouched.\n3 Both – Apply new updates to both filesystems and always boot on the first root partition as the active partition. Warning: A bad update will have nothing to rollback to; the device will have to go through a recovery process.\nEndpoint Setup – The configured endpoint ready with a new update(.zi image). The endpoint can be either an https URL or an external mass storage device like a USB stick.\nEndpoint – Type the endpoint where the .zi image resides for the device to pull updates from. The endpoint will be checked for validity.\nExample https URL: https://bootware.s3.amazonaws.com/zymbit_bookworm64_1.1.zi Example USB stick: /dev/sda1\nWireless Setup – Bootware supports pulling updates via Wifi or LAN connections. Wifi credentials need to be provided in order for bootware to access the wifi during updates. If no wireless credentials are provided, the wireless interface is disabled in zboot.\nSSID - Provide the Wifi SSID Passphrase - Provide the Wifi passphrase Save and Exit. You may also choose to Revert to the default configuration.\nSee also zb-update\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" zb-wizard Description Bootware Preview includes a dialog enabled tool …","ref":"/bootware1.3.2/archive/bootware-one-zero-general/utilities/zbwizard/","tags":"","title":"Zymbit Bootware Configuration Wizard"},{"body":"What is Zymbit’s Wallet SDK? Blockchain accounts, signatures, and transactions have an additional layer of complexity over traditional cryptographic keys and signatures. Our Wallet SDK aims to abstract away this complexity, enabling you to create and manage multiple blockchain wallets and seamlessly interact with smart contracts in your applicaitons without having to deal with their technical intricacies.\nInstallation pip install zymbitwalletsdk ETH Keyring Examples Creating an ETH Keyring If you have an existing wallet on your module, you can initialize an ETH Keyring using either the wallet name or its corresponding master slot. Here’s how:\nfrom zymbitwalletsdk import ZymbitEthKeyring keyring = ZymbitEthKeyring(wallet_name = \"MyExampleWallet\") print(keyring) or\nfrom zymbitwalletsdk import ZymbitEthKeyring keyring = ZymbitEthKeyring(master_slot = 16) print(keyring) Output:\nZymbitEthKeyring( type = ETH base_path = m/44'/60'/0'/0 wallet_name = MyExampleWallet master_slot = 16 base_slot = 20 accounts = [ (Path: m/44'/60'/0'/0/0, Address: 0x93D458d6B14A02943A07708a24D8A9F142Fc5A00, Slot: 26) (Path: m/44'/60'/0'/0/1, Address: 0x9fB80f688e4a4f68cd94e0DD4263B03cA7CC52ff, Slot: 27) (Path: m/44'/60'/0'/0/2, Address: 0x29e9f7D65886c6c1e164AFd4823A477eB0F1F75a, Slot: 28) ] ) Adding Accounts There are three methods you can use to add accounts.

It never blinks with the described pattern of once (in Development mode) or three times (in Production mode) every three seconds. Expand for Answer A: Check the following:\nCheck that the Raspberry Pi power is sufficient. The red LED on most Raspberry Pi models indicates if the Pi is being powered adequately. If it is not lit at all or flashes intermittently, try a different power supply or a different USB cable.\nMake sure that you have enabled i2c support using raspi-config BEFORE your install the software. Also, when you enable i2c communications be sure to follow the enable-disable-enable sequence.\nIf i2c support has been enabled correctly and the HSM4 LED is still rapidly blinking, check proper physical installation of the HSM4 as detailed in this “Getting Started” guide.\nHSM4 uses GPIO header pins 3 and 5 for i2c communications and pin 7 as an interrupt signal to the Pi. Pin 7 should preferably be dedicated exclusively to HSM4. Other devices may share the i2c bus with HSM4, but there may still be address conflicts. By default, HSM4 uses slave address 0x30. If the address conflict cannot be resolved on the other i2c devices, there is a way of changing the i2c address through an API call. Using this application, the HSM4 address can be changed anywhere in the ranges of 0x30-0x37 or 0x60-0x67.\nExpand for API information to change i2c address Python: set_i2c_address\nC: int zkSetI2CAddr ( zkCTX ctx, int addr)\nSee API Documentation\nOftentimes the 1-Wire interface relies on pin 7 (GPIO 4) for communication. If the 1-Wire interface is enabled, try disabling through raspi-config. If that resolves the problem take steps to either move the HSM4 interrupt signal from GPIO 4 or the 1-Wire interface from GPIO 4.\nif the directory at /var/lib/zymbit or any of the files and/or subdirectories are corrupted or deleted, the HSM4 will fail to work. IMPORTANT: if this happens when the HSM4 is locked (i.e. Production Mode), the HSM4 can never be used again.\nQ: The LED blinks rapidly when booting, but eventually turns off. It doesn’t blink once or three times every 3 seconds as described. Expand for Answer A: This issue could be caused by the same issues described in the first question (Why does the LED continue to blink rapidly?). Additionally, this can be caused if a locked (Production Mode) HSM4 is moved to another Pi.\nQ: What do the different LED blinking patterns mean? Expand for Answer 1 second very rapid flash, 1 second off, 8 slow blinks This indicates interrupted communications. 1 second very rapid flash, 1 second off, 5 slow blinks This indicates a failure to communicate with ATECC. The most likely cause is the HSM4 is in Production Mode, tamper detect was set to self-destruct, and a tamper detect event caused the HSM4 to self-destruct. If tamper detect is not armed, this indicates a hardware problem. Constant rapid blinking (waiting for host to connect) This indicates that you HSM4 is operational but has not bound to the host. If the HSM4 continues to blink this pattern, it could mean that there is a problem with the host Pi or that the i2c is not configured or that the i2c and wake pins are not making contact. Once every 3 seconds This indicates that your HSM4 is working and running. Three rapid blinks every 3 seconds This indicates the HSM4 is in Production Mode and is working and running. Rapid blinking then LED off permanently This indicates the HSM4 is in Production Mode but cannot bind with the RPi / SD card pair. In Production Mode the binding with a particular Pi and SD card becomes permanent. Most likely cause for this is that the HSM4, the SD card, or the PI has been swapped out. Q: How do I set an alternative I2C address? Expand for Answer A: You can change the I2C address through our standard APIs:\nC: int zkSetI2CAddr ( zkCTX ctx, int addr) Python: set_i2c_address The I2C communication between the Zymkey and the Host is encrypted, but will not interfere with other devices on the same bus (assuming there is no address conflict).\nSee API Documentation\nQ: Why does my HSM4 fail to restart after cycling power? Expand for Answer A: HSM4 monitors the quality of 5V power coming into the host computer. If the voltage drops below a specified limit, even momentarily, then HSM4 will disable all security services to the host. This is a security feature to prevent power cycle and brown-own attacks. If you are powering a display, modem, or other power-hungry device from your Pi, then check the capacity and quality of your power supply. Learn more \u003e\nQ: Why is my HSM4 “invisible” to the i2c-tools suite? Expand for Answer A: Some people have become accustomed to using i2c-detect to do a first level check for correct installation and baseline functionality of i2c devices. However, these tools only really work if the i2c device communicates via a protocol that sits on top of i2c called SMBus or SMB (System Management Bus). Instead, HSM4 communicates to the host at a much more fundamental level, in part because the HSM4 protocol traffic is encrypted.\nYou can tell if you successfully installed it by observing the blue LED. If it is flashing once every 3 seconds, then binding completed. You can also use the systemctl command. It should say “active (running)”:\nsystemctl status zkifc\nQ: If the install fails, can I run it more than once? Expand for Answer A: Yes, you should have no problem running it multiple times if it were to fail.\nEncrypting Root File System Summary of steps Start with a blank USB device. USB storage should be twice the size of the SD card. The process for encrypting the SD card stops zkifc. The blue LED will flash rapidly during the encryption process. It will return to blinking once every 3 seconds when complete. The process will automatically do two reboots. Be patient. If the encryption process does not complete, it’s best to start fresh and try again. Q: How can I check if the system matches the default parameters? Expand for Answer A: lsblk will show you the partitions. Look for the name of your / partition (default is mmcblk0p2) and the USB device (default is sda). Example output:\nNAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT mmcblk0 179:0 0 14.9G 0 disk |-mmcblk0p1 179:1 0 256M 0 part /boot `-mmcblk0p2 179:2 0 14.6G 0 part / sda 8:0 0 32.0G 0 disk |_sda1 8:1 0 32.0G 0 part Q: How can I monitor the status after phase 1 reboot? Expand for Answer A: Once you get to the second phase and login, you can monitor progress with\njournalctl -fu cfg_SD_crfs\nThat will show you progress of the second half of the encryption process.\nQ: Can I re-run encryption with the same USB stick? Expand for Answer A: The script is designed to re-use information on the USB stick to encrypt a “golden” image in production on more than one device. If the file original_zk_root.tgz exists on the USB stick, it will use that file and skip the step of creating a whole new tarball of the rootfs. If you truly want to start over, start by reformatting/erasing your USB stick.\nQ: If my PI automounts the USB device, will that interfere with the process? Expand for Answer A: The script attempts to unmount the external device, but in some cricumstances the device may stay mounted and the process will fail. You will get a message either on your screen or in journalctl -fu cfg_SD_crfs during the second phase indicating the drive was already mounted. Unmount the drive and try again.\n# Check /dev/sda* mount points for devices mounted to /media/* lsblk # if mounted, unmount sudo umount /media* # re-run service sudo systemctl restart # monitor progress journalctl -fu cfg_SD_crfs Q: How can I confirm my file system is encrypted and protected? Expand for Answer A: Since zkifc is stopped during the process, the blue LED will flash rapidly until the whole process completes. Once both of the automautic reboots are completed, the blue LED will return to flashing once every 3 seconds.\nlsblk will show you that you now have a “cryptrfs” partition under your mmcblk0p2 (default)\ndf -h will also show “/dev/mapper/cryptrfs” for the “/” file system.\nIf your system reboots twice, the LED returns to flashing once every 3 seconds, and lsblk displays a “cryptrfs” partition, you can be confident your system is encrypted and protected.\nFor more help, see Zymbit’s Community Forum. Features Q: What curves are supported for Zymbit products? Expand for Answer Zymkey and HSM4: NIST P-256 and secp256r1\nHSM6: NIST P-256, secp256r1, secp256k1, X25519, ED25519\nQ: How do I use HSM6’s store_foreign_public_key function to store a Zymkey or HSM4 public key on HSM6? Expand for Answer A: The easiest way is to save the HSM4 key directly to a binary file, copy that file to the HSM6 and read in the binary file.\nHSM4 side:\n#!/usr/bin/python3 import zymkey # Get the public key from slot 0 and save it in a file pub_key_file = '/tmp/pub_key_slot0' slot = 0 key = zymkey.client.get_public_key(slot) with open(pub_key_file, \"wb\") as f: f.write(key) copy /tmp/pub_key_slot0 over to the HSM6 PI\nHSM6 side:\n#!/usr/bin/python3 import zymkey key_file = \"/tmp/pub_key_slot0\" key = open(key_file, \"rb\").read() # Store the key in the foreign key store foreign_slot = zymkey.client.store_foreign_public_key('secp256r1', key) Q: How can I reset the clock to the current timestamp? Expand for Answer A: The clock will sync to the current timestamp once the Pi has achieved NTP sync. This requires you to have access to the Internet.\nQ: How do I access the devices (RTC, accelerometer, crypto) on HSM4? Expand for Answer A: For Zymkey and HSMs, kernel drivers and libraries for all of the devices are included in the Zymkey software package via the APIs.\nQ: My GPG Key expired and I cannot access the Zymkey Repository. How do I update the Key? Expand for Answer A: You can update your existing key with the following command:\ncurl -L https://zk-sw-repo.s3.amazonaws.com/apt-zymkey-pubkey.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor --yes -o /usr/share/keyrings/zymbit.gpg Q: Can the HSM4 detect if the SD card has been removed? Expand for Answer A: No, but perimeter detect can be configured to prevent access to the SD card. When a tamper event is detected, the HSM4 will, when properly configured via the API, destroy all critical key material and the root fs will fail to be decrypted upon boot.\nBattery \u0026 Power Questions Q: Should I use an external battery on my Zymkey or HSM? Expand for Answer A: The following table compares Zymkey and HSM operational modes while connected to Main Power, Battery Power, and No Power.\nThe battery is required to maintain the Real Time Clock and the perimeter detect circuits when the host power is removed. Without the battery, these two functions will not be active when the host power is removed.\nQ: What happens when the battery dies? How can I change the battery when it dies, without self-destructing my device? Expand for Answer A: If the battery dies and the host is not connected to power, some features will go out, such as Perimeter Detect and Real Time Clock. See the table below for more information.\nWith Zymkey and HSM4, if tamper detect is enabled and the battery dies or is removed, the device will self-destruct. This is an intentional security feature. If tamper detect is NOT enabled, you should connect the host device to power to change the battery.\nHSM6 has a battery monitoring feature to help the user prevent the battery from dying. If the battery dies, HSM6 users have the ability to choose whether the device should self-destruct or hold in reset mode until the battery is changed.\nKernel \u0026 Kernel Boot Questions Q: Can you tell the kernel not to run a shell? Expand for Answer A: Someone could easily replace the kernel and, while it is possible to configure initramfs to not permit the busybox shell to, that can be sidestepped as well. Even if you hack your own changes to the kernel to ignore the init option, someone could replace your kernel. Also, kernel updates would have to be done manually and the updates from the apt repo would have to be blacklisted.\nQ: Can you tell the kernel to ignore cmdline.txt? Expand for Answer A: There are many reasons why this is infeasible, but the main one is that, since the GPU initially functions as a bootloader processor during boot and since Broadcom has not made the GPU compiler publicly available as well as the source code for the bootloader, one cannot simply compile their own code that would ignore cmdline.txt.\nQ: Is it possible to encrypt the boot partition? Expand for Answer A: No because the GPU bootloader does not have encryption features implemented and, even in lieu of that, it does not know how to communicate with HSM4. The best solution, then, would be to implement an independent secure boot procedure. As mentioned above, we are currently working on adding this feature in a future product.\nProduction (“self-destruct”) Mode Questions Q: When using the perimeter-detect feature, does the “self-destruct” mode work (destroy all of its key material) even when the Lock Tab hasn’t been cut? Expand for Answer A: Self-destruct mode works only after the Lock Tab has been cut.\nQ: Is there a way to turn off “self-destruct” mode? Expand for Answer A: No, once turned on, “self-destruct” mode is permanent.\nQ: If my HSM4 does “self-destruct,” can I create new keys and reuse the hardware? Expand for Answer The SBC and SD card hardware will be reusable. Because the SD card contents are encrypted and the decryption key was destroyed, the data is lost. The HSM4 will not be reusable because the key slots will be destroyed. Q: If I cut the Lock-Tab on a HSM4, can I move that HSM4 to another Pi or change the SD card? Expand for Answer A: No. Cutting the Lock-Tab permanently binds that instance of HSM4 to the specific instances of host computer and SD card. This is a security feature to prevent credentials being moved from one host to another. DO NOT cut the Lock-Tab if you are still in development and expect to change the host or SD cards.\nQ: Will HSM4 still self-destruct, even when my SBC is powered off? Expand for Answer A: Yes, because HSM4 is battery powered. As long as the battery is sufficiently charged, it will still self-destruct.\nOther Q: Where can I learn about and/or pre-order future products? Expand for Answer A: Sign up for our new product email updates at the bottom of Zymbit’s homepage.\nQ: Which SBCs are compatible with HSM4? Expand for Answer Electrically, the Zymkey-I2C will interface to any single board computer using I2C. Check compatibility with your particular Linux distribution. Raspberry Pi 3, 3B+, 4, Zero RPi Compute Module 3, 4 Q: Does HSM4 work with Arduino? Expand for Answer A: We have no plans to release an Arduino shield version. While we love Arduinos and use them all the time, they generally don’t have enough resources to handle cryptographic operations at this level.\nQ: Does HSM4 work with BeagleBone? Expand for Answer A: Zymbit does not officially support the BeagleBoard platform at this time.\nQ: Which operating systems does HSM4 support? Expand for Answer Q: How much power does HSM4 consume?

In this post we will outline the important factors of power quality management and explain how Zymkey manages the security of your device when power quality is poor.\nPower Quality Management Unlike software which is digital, deterministic and repeatable, power is analog and subject to the laws of physics and electrical engineering. Fortunately, with good design and a basic understanding, power quality can also be deterministic and repeatable. We’ll use the Raspberry Pi to explain the basic concepts.\nSafe operating zone The Raspberry Pi is designed to operate of a 5V (nominal) power supply, delivering 2A or more. (more on current rating later). This voltage is widely used in USB and mobile devices, making it easy to buy a power supply (and more on that later). In reality, power supplies have a tolerance on the output voltage, typically ±5%, which means the output voltage can range from a low of 4.75V to a high of 5.25V. The Raspberry Pi is designed to operate reliably in this Safe Operating Zone.\nBrown out zone - symptoms If the supply voltage dips below the safe operating zone then this can put the SBC into a less determinstic state - commonly known as “brown out” zone. Symptoms of brown outs range from irritating to catostrophic, depending upon where in the brown zone your SBC is operating:\nApparently Benign BUT Significant\nRED PWR LED on RPI 3 is off or flickering Power Warning - thunderbolt on console GUI IMPORTANT: The low voltage warning system is designed to protect your application. Use it ! It will save you time and money in debugging erratic system behavior and potentially expensive field failures and recalls.\nErratic Behavior\nGPIO digital and serial bus signals behave inconsistently USB peripherals behave inconsistently Catastrophic Failures\nIrregular cycling through reset and reboot, at which time vulnerabilities in the boot sequence or memory write cycles might be exposed (more in a later post).\nRegular cycling through reset and reboot - this can happen when your application program calls up more resources that consume more power at regular times. For example turning on additional cores for intense image processing, or turning on a USB peripheral or LCD display.\nSD card failures, corrupted SD card contents\nWhy Good Power Design Matters A well-designed SBC will include elements of power management that monitor what is happening to the input power supply using a layer of hardware protection and supervision. In the case of the Raspberry Pi, there is a voltage monitor circuit that triggers a ‘Low Voltage Warning’ event when the supply voltage dips below 4.63V ±0.07V. This Low Voltage event is used to warn your software application of a potential loss of power and perhaps initiate an orderly shutdown sequence before a hard reset of the CPU occurs. If a hard reset does occur it will literally force the hardware to reset giving no time to store data or program cached in memory. In the case of the Pi, a hardware reset occurs at ~3.2V.\nSecure Power Zone - Zymkey Power Quality Monitor Zymkey includes a similar power monitoring system although it’s purpose is slightly different: it’s purpose is to prevent access to cryptographic keys during unstable power conditions (resulting from an intentional power vector attack, or unintentional system failure).\nIn the event of poor power quality the Zymkey instantaneosly shuts down access to the security API and communication channels and retreats into sleep mode (no sleep mode on Zymkey). In sleep mode the Zymkey continues to monitor the quality of the 5V power rail and when conditions have stabilized it reactivates the security API and communication channels.\nOther Considerations Static \u0026 Dynamic Power Loads Most power supplies are simply specified in terms of Voltage and Current Ratings. Better ones will specify the output voltage at different current outputs. The ratings are helpful, but not enough to determine if you have a suitable power supply that will operate reliably over the long term under different system load conditions.\nReal systems include devices that turn on and off, sometimes quickly (eg LCD switched from black to white, or multiple I/O’s turning on simultaneously, or USB powered HDD spinning up). In these situations, a device switching on will create a dynamic (quickly changing) load on the power supply which can cause a momentary dip in the voltage as it tries to deliver the required surge current.\nAverage power supplies often don’t have good dynamic load response and can dip momentarily or intermittently below a recommended operating voltage (4.63V in the case of the RPi). Good quality power supplies have a better dynamic performance and can respond very quickly to changes in loads.\nQUESTIONS? Is my power supply good enough ? Don’t be in denial. Developers unfamiliar with embedded hardware may not have the necessary test equipment or experience to determine the quality of their power supply. But denying there might be a problem does not make it go away! So here are a few tips when checking power quality:\nA standard multimeter will NOT give you a good indication of power quality: most take average readings that filter out (not see) any potentially harmful transients or AC components.\nMonitor the power rail with an oscilloscope, during static and dynamic loads that you would expect to see when your product is deployed.\nThankfully the designers of Raspberry Pi have provided two very helpful diagnostic tools: A Red Power LED and a Low_Pwr warning symbol (thunderbolt icon) on the user display.\nIf the Red Power LED is not illuminated this means the supply voltage is inadequate, falling below 4.63V. (The newer Pi(s) have a well engineered power circuit, and may continue to function even if the input voltage is below spec; the same may not be true of peripherals). The GUI had an rainbow indicator (replaced by a lightning bolt) which comes up in the top right if the voltage is inadequate. This has a 3 second timer, and may display even if the LED appears to be lit. Check out the Raspberry Pi Power Requirements for a more complete description of the Pi power requirements.\nCan I disable Zymkey power quality monitor? No, not for standard products. This is an intentional design feature that protects the security of your critical keys and Pi to Zumkey communications. If your system requires a different behaviour then please Contact Zymbit engineering services.\nUseful References Raspberry Pi Hardware reference, including schematics ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Applicable Products The information included in this post applies to …","ref":"/reference/power-quality/","tags":"","title":"Power Quality Considerations"},{"body":" zbcli update Description Requires superuser privilege.\nUtility to perform Bootware updates; re-partitions and loads images into the Active, Backup or Both partitions\nUsage zbcli update [OPTIONS] Options: -f, --key-file \u003cKEY_FILE\u003e Public pem file verifying the update (software signed) -y Says `yes` to all prompts.

Bootware supports various Raspberry Pi computers and requires a Zymbit HSM or SCM to run. Bootware takes advantage of security features of various Zymbit products and protects credentials via the HSM.\nA free ZYMKEY is available when you sign up for a Bootware trial. See Get Bootware\nIf you want to jump right in, Click here to Get Started! What is Bootware? Bootware is a full-featured native OS switcher/manager with first rate support for encrypted root and data partitions. Bootware is not a hypervisor.\nBootware supports both manual and automatic rollback between A and B installations. If rollback fails, Bootware is able to enter recovery to reload one of the installations from either a local image or a remote secure endpoint.\nBootware works with 64-bit versions of Raspberry Pi OS and Ubuntu on Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 and the various compute module variants.\nBootware is not an OS, therefore custom OS builds are generally supported. For larger orders, Zymbit is able to offer device programming and image validation services of custom user OS builds.\nBootware is not an IoT cloud stack, and interoperates well with most popular stacks. Bootware manages the relationship between bare metal and OS installations as simply, securely, and robustly as possible.\nBootware correctly handles potentially conflicting sets of kernels and boot artifacts, allowing for major kernel upgrades to occur without undue distress.\nBootware fully isolates bootable root partitions with separate sets of LUKS credentials, which are securely injected into user s OS initramfs images. Bootware supports a shared data partition, for which the credentials are distributed to new installations. Each new installation gets a clean new set of keys and one root partition cannot access the other.\nNew installations are deployed from within Bootware’s secure enclave, zboot, which boots straight via secure boot. zboot is able to download, validate, and deploy updates without relying on a potentially compromised OS installation to install the next new clean image.\nBootware has a robust workflow for update signing, which may use either hardware or software key options. Update signing occurs on a dedicated publishing node.\nBootware uses full image forklift updates for major OS installations. Partial overlay updates are also supported, and may be installed directly from user mode.\nBootware runs of top of Zymbit’s security services package, which is required to use Zymbit security hardware.\nBootware has additional integrations with Zymbit Secure Edge Nodes, which may be purchased to development and production use, or may be used as reference designs for custom hardware. For highly secure products, such as Secure Compute Modules, Bootware is almost essential in order to apply updates without the ability to use Pi burner tools, which are intentionally disabled.\nBootware installation locations: Bootware secure uboot and the secure enclave, zboot, along with encrypted configurations files are installed in into /boot.\nBootware uses Zymbit LUKS initramfs unlock code already present in standard Zymbit driver package, but will inject credentials before encrypting the initramfs together with the kernel and boot artifacts into an immutable boot image for secure uboot.\nBootware installs zbcli and Bootware scripts into user OS. User must ensure that these packages are present in user images to be deployed using Bootware. User mode tools manage Bootware settings and check for updates on USB drives or on remote endpoints. zbcli also allows user to trigger manual rollback and update installations. Once a suitable update is located, Bootware reboots into zboot to install.\nBootware boot sequence: For Zymbit Secure Compute Modules only, supervisor-based pre-boot environment validates and repairs /boot partition. Zymkey and HSM products do not have this feature.\nPi ROM code boots and loads standard Pi artifacts.\nZymbit uboot loads\nIf user boot is to proceed normally:\nUboot loads, decrypts, and validates boot package for the active boot partition. The package includes everything required to boot that installation inclusive of kernel, initramfs, args, device tree objects, etc.\nBoot counter is incremented and control is passed to the kernel.\nOnce in initramfs, zbunlock is invoked to connect to the HSM and to decrypt LUKS credentials that have been previously injected into initramfs. /root is mounted.\nOnce boot is complete, boot counter is reset. If the boot fails, and the system reboots for whichever reason, the process repeats with boot counter incrementing.\nIf the boot counter has exceeded the threshold, rollback occurs:\nUboot loads zboot to switch to the backup partition\nSystem reboots\nUboot attempts to boot the backup boot partition in the same way it boots the active partition.\nOnce boot is complete, boot counter is reset. If the boot fails, and the system reboots for whichever reason, the process repeats with boot counter incrementing.\nIf the boot counter for the backup partition also exceeds the threshold without a successful boot, the system enters recovery mode:\nUboot loads zboot.\nZboot attempts to locate an image to install either on a local USB drive or on a known remote endpoint.\nIf the image is found, it is installed, and then the system is rebooted into it. All images are checked for correct signatures before applying them to the system.\nIf the image is not found, zboot enters console interactive mode and asks for endpoint information. Any image to be installed must have a proper signature.\nBootware is designed with the singular goal to ensure that properly validated and installed image is booted successfully on user’s machine.\nAdditional Resources Register for Bootware Technical Updates\nMore information on Bootware on zymbit.com\nBootware Community\nLinks to Bootware Documentation Sections ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Bootware is a secure integrated tool for managing multiple Linux OS …","ref":"/bootware1.3.2/archive/bootware1.3.0/","tags":"","title":"Bootware 1.3.0"},{"body":" ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" ","ref":"/bootware1.3.2/archive/bootware-one-zero-general/features/","tags":"","title":"Features and Implementation"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"Additional information on Bootware features and implementation","excerpt":"Additional information on Bootware features and implementation","ref":"/bootware1.3.2/archive/bootware1.2.2/features/","tags":"","title":"Features and Implementation"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"Additional information on Bootware features and implementation","excerpt":"Additional information on Bootware features and implementation","ref":"/bootware1.3.2/archive/bootware1.3.0/features/","tags":"","title":"Features and Implementation"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"Additional information on Bootware features and implementation","excerpt":"Additional information on Bootware features and implementation","ref":"/bootware1.3.2/features/","tags":"","title":"Features and Implementation"},{"body":" zb-update Description Requires superuser privilege.\nUtility to perform Bootware Updates; re-partitions and loads images into the Active, Backup or Both partitions\nUsage zb-update [ [-k \u003ckey-slot\u003e] [--key-file=\u003cfilepath\u003e] [-w] | [-y] [-r] ] Flags Description --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -k, --key-slot [int] Key-slot of HSM for verifying the update.

On the console, you will see:\n“Loading: Encrypted zboot please wait…” message, which takes around 4-5min. The A/B partitions will be configured and setup for LUKS encryption protected by the Zymbit SCM It will then take a few minutes to get/unpack tarballs from the image. It will take some time to unpack the image into the A/B root partitions depending on the size of the image. Once it’s done unpacking the image to the A and B partitions, it will boot into the updated ACTIVE partition. You can use lsblk to examine the partitions.

Most of the problems we see are from a poor power source. Start with a good power supply from the PI foundation or Canakit, not a phone charger. The recommended power for the PI4 is 5V and 3 amps. For a PI5, the recommended power supply should provide 5V, 5 amps. I2C enabled. Double check that you have enabled the I2C bus. An easy way to check is “ls -l /dev/i2c-1”. If /dev/i2c-1 exists, the I2C bus is enabled. apt update and upgrade. Be sure that your software is up to date. Installation. The curl script will reboot your system once completed. After the reboot, the blue LED on your Zymbit device should blink once every 3 seconds. You must get to this step before proceeding to encryption, etc. If your issue is not related to any of the above list, read through the FAQ below to see if your issue is answered. If you still do not see a solution to your problem, reach out on our Community Forum. Thank you!\nQ: Why does the LED continue to blink rapidly? It never blinks with the described pattern of once (in Development mode) or three times (in Production mode) every three seconds. Expand for Answer A: Check the following:\nCheck that the Raspberry Pi power is sufficient. The red LED on most Raspberry Pi models indicates if the Pi is being powered adequately. If it is not lit at all or flashes intermittently, try a different power supply or a different USB cable.\nMake sure that you have enabled i2c support using raspi-config BEFORE your install the software. Also, when you enable i2c communications be sure to follow the enable-disable-enable sequence.\nIf i2c support has been enabled correctly and the HSM6 LED is still rapidly blinking, check proper physical installation of the HSM6 as detailed in this “Getting Started” guide.\nHSM6 uses GPIO header pins 3 and 5 for i2c communications and pin 7 as an interrupt signal to the Pi. Pin 7 should preferably be dedicated exclusively to HSM6. Other devices may share the i2c bus with HSM6, but there may still be address conflicts. By default, HSM6 uses slave address 0x30. If the address conflict cannot be resolved on the other i2c devices, there is a way of changing the i2c address through an API call. Using this application, the HSM6 address can be changed anywhere in the ranges of 0x30-0x37 or 0x60-0x67.\nExpand for API information to change i2c address Python: set_i2c_address\nC: int zkSetI2CAddr ( zkCTX ctx, int addr)\nSee API Documentation\nOftentimes the 1-Wire interface relies on pin 7 (GPIO 4) for communication. If the 1-Wire interface is enabled, try disabling through raspi-config. If that resolves the problem take steps to either move the HSM6 interrupt signal from GPIO 4 or the 1-Wire interface from GPIO 4.\nif the directory at /var/lib/zymbit or any of the files and/or subdirectories are corrupted or deleted, the HSM6 will fail to work. IMPORTANT: if this happens when the HSM6 is locked (i.e. Production Mode), the HSM6 can never be used again.\nQ: The LED blinks rapidly when booting, but eventually turns off. It doesn’t blink once or three times every 3 seconds as described. Expand for Answer A: This issue could be caused by the same issues described in the first question (Why does the LED continue to blink rapidly?). Additionally, this can be caused if a locked (Production Mode) HSM6 is moved to another Pi.\nQ: What do the different LED blinking patterns mean? Expand for Answer 1 second very rapid flash, 1 second off, 8 slow blinks This indicates interrupted communications. 1 second very rapid flash, 1 second off, 5 slow blinks This indicates a failure to communicate with ATECC. The most likely cause is the HSM6 is in Production Mode, tamper detect was set to self-destruct, and a tamper detect event caused the HSM6 to self-destruct. If tamper detect is not armed, this indicates a hardware problem. Constant rapid blinking (waiting for host to connect) This indicates that you HSM6 is operational but has not bound to the host. If the HSM6 continues to blink this pattern, it could mean that there is a problem with the host Pi or that the i2c is not configured or that the i2c and wake pins are not making contact. Once every 3 seconds This indicates that your HSM6 is working and running. Three rapid blinks every 3 seconds This indicates the HSM6 is in Production Mode and is working and running. Rapid blinking then LED off permanently This indicates the HSM6 is in Production Mode but cannot bind with the RPi / SD card pair. In Production Mode the binding with a particular Pi and SD card becomes permanent. Most likely cause for this is that the HSM6, the SD card, or the PI has been swapped out. Q: How do I set an alternative I2C address? Expand for Answer A: You can change the I2C address through our standard APIs:\nC: int zkSetI2CAddr ( zkCTX ctx, int addr) Python: set_i2c_address The I2C communication between the Zymkey and the Host is encrypted, but will not interfere with other devices on the same bus (assuming there is no address conflict).\nSee API Documentation\nQ: Why does my HSM6 fail to restart after cycling power? Expand for Answer A: HSM6 monitors the quality of 5V power coming into the host computer. If the voltage drops below a specified limit, even momentarily, then HSM6 will disable all security services to the host. This is a security feature to prevent power cycle and brown-own attacks. If you are powering a display, modem, or other power-hungry device from your Pi, then check the capacity and quality of your power supply. Learn more \u003e\nQ: Why is my HSM6 “invisible” to the i2c-tools suite? Expand for Answer A: Some people have become accustomed to using i2c-detect to do a first level check for correct installation and baseline functionality of i2c devices. However, these tools only really work if the i2c device communicates via a protocol that sits on top of i2c called SMBus or SMB (System Management Bus). Instead, HSM6 communicates to the host at a much more fundamental level, in part because the HSM6 protocol traffic is encrypted.\nYou can tell if you successfully installed it by observing the blue LED. If it is flashing once every 3 seconds, then binding completed. You can also use the systemctl command. It should say “active (running)”:\nsystemctl status zkifc\nQ: If the install fails, can I run it more than once? Expand for Answer A: Yes, you should have no problem running it multiple times if it were to fail.\nEncrypting Root File System Summary of steps Start with a blank USB device. USB storage should be twice the size of the SD card. The process for encrypting the SD card stops zkifc. The blue LED will flash rapidly during the encryption process. It will return to blinking once every 3 seconds when complete. The process will automatically do two reboots. Be patient. If the encryption process does not complete, it’s best to start fresh and try again. Q: How can I check if the system matches the default parameters? Expand for Answer A: lsblk will show you the partitions. Look for the name of your / partition (default is mmcblk0p2) and the USB device (default is sda). Example output:\nNAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT mmcblk0 179:0 0 14.9G 0 disk |-mmcblk0p1 179:1 0 256M 0 part /boot `-mmcblk0p2 179:2 0 14.6G 0 part / sda 8:0 0 32.0G 0 disk |_sda1 8:1 0 32.0G 0 part Q: How can I monitor the status after phase 1 reboot? Expand for Answer A: Once you get to the second phase and login, you can monitor progress with\njournalctl -fu cfg_SD_crfs\nThat will show you progress of the second half of the encryption process.\nQ: Can I re-run encryption with the same USB stick? Expand for Answer A: The script is designed to re-use information on the USB stick to encrypt a “golden” image in production on more than one device. If the file original_zk_root.tgz exists on the USB stick, it will use that file and skip the step of creating a whole new tarball of the rootfs. If you truly want to start over, start by reformatting/erasing your USB stick.\nQ: If my PI automounts the USB device, will that interfere with the process? Expand for Answer A: The script attempts to unmount the external device, but in some cricumstances the device may stay mounted and the process will fail. You will get a message either on your screen or in journalctl -fu cfg_SD_crfs during the second phase indicating the drive was already mounted. Unmount the drive and try again.\n# Check /dev/sda* mount points for devices mounted to /media/* lsblk # if mounted, unmount sudo umount /media* # re-run service sudo systemctl restart # monitor progress journalctl -fu cfg_SD_crfs Q: How can I confirm my file system is encrypted and protected? Expand for Answer A: Since zkifc is stopped during the process, the blue LED will flash rapidly until the whole process completes. Once both of the automautic reboots are completed, the blue LED will return to flashing once every 3 seconds.\nlsblk will show you that you now have a “cryptrfs” partition under your mmcblk0p2 (default)\ndf -h will also show “/dev/mapper/cryptrfs” for the “/” file system.\nIf your system reboots twice, the LED returns to flashing once every 3 seconds, and lsblk displays a “cryptrfs” partition, you can be confident your system is encrypted and protected.\nFor more help, see Zymbit’s Community Forum. Features Q: What curves are supported for Zymbit products? Expand for Answer Zymkey and HSM4: NIST P-256 and secp256r1\nHSM6: NIST P-256, secp256r1, secp256k1, X25519, ED25519\nQ: How do I use HSM6’s store_foreign_public_key function to store a Zymkey or HSM4 public key on HSM6? Expand for Answer A: The easiest way is to save the HSM4 key directly to a binary file, copy that file to the HSM6 and read in the binary file.\nHSM4 side:\n#!/usr/bin/python3 import zymkey # Get the public key from slot 0 and save it in a file pub_key_file = '/tmp/pub_key_slot0' slot = 0 key = zymkey.client.get_public_key(slot) with open(pub_key_file, \"wb\") as f: f.write(key) copy /tmp/pub_key_slot0 over to the HSM6 PI\nHSM6 side:\n#!/usr/bin/python3 import zymkey key_file = \"/tmp/pub_key_slot0\" key = open(key_file, \"rb\").read() # Store the key in the foreign key store foreign_slot = zymkey.client.store_foreign_public_key('secp256r1', key) Q: How can I reset the clock to the current timestamp? Expand for Answer A: The clock will sync to the current timestamp once the Pi has achieved NTP sync. This requires you to have access to the Internet.\nQ: How do I access the devices (RTC, accelerometer, crypto) on HSM6? Expand for Answer A: For Zymkey and HSMs, kernel drivers and libraries for all of the devices are included in the Zymkey software package via the APIs.\nQ: My GPG Key expired and I cannot access the Zymkey Repository. How do I update the Key? Expand for Answer A: You can update your existing key with the following command:\ncurl -L https://zk-sw-repo.s3.amazonaws.com/apt-zymkey-pubkey.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor --yes -o /usr/share/keyrings/zymbit.gpg Q: Can the HSM6 detect if the SD card has been removed? Expand for Answer A: No, but perimeter detect can be configured to prevent access to the SD card. When a tamper event is detected, the HSM6 will, when properly configured via the API, destroy all critical key material and the root fs will fail to be decrypted upon boot.\nBattery \u0026 Power Questions Q: Should I use an external battery on my Zymkey or HSM? Expand for Answer A: The following table compares Zymkey and HSM operational modes while connected to Main Power, Battery Power, and No Power.\nThe battery is required to maintain the Real Time Clock and the perimeter detect circuits when the host power is removed. Without the battery, these two functions will not be active when the host power is removed.\nQ: What happens when the battery dies? How can I change the battery when it dies, without self-destructing my device? Expand for Answer A: If the battery dies and the host is not connected to power, some features will go out, such as Perimeter Detect and Real Time Clock. See the table below for more information.\nWith Zymkey and HSM4, if tamper detect is enabled and the battery dies or is removed, the device will self-destruct. This is an intentional security feature. If tamper detect is NOT enabled, you should connect the host device to power to change the battery.\nHSM6 has a battery monitoring feature to help the user prevent the battery from dying. If the battery dies, HSM6 users have the ability to choose whether the device should self-destruct or hold in reset mode until the battery is changed.\nKernel \u0026 Kernel Boot Questions Q: Can you tell the kernel not to run a shell? Expand for Answer A: Someone could easily replace the kernel and, while it is possible to configure initramfs to not permit the busybox shell to, that can be sidestepped as well. Even if you hack your own changes to the kernel to ignore the init option, someone could replace your kernel. Also, kernel updates would have to be done manually and the updates from the apt repo would have to be blacklisted.\nQ: Can you tell the kernel to ignore cmdline.txt? Expand for Answer A: There are many reasons why this is infeasible, but the main one is that, since the GPU initially functions as a bootloader processor during boot and since Broadcom has not made the GPU compiler publicly available as well as the source code for the bootloader, one cannot simply compile their own code that would ignore cmdline.txt.\nQ: Is it possible to encrypt the boot partition? Expand for Answer A: No because the GPU bootloader does not have encryption features implemented and, even in lieu of that, it does not know how to communicate with HSM6. The best solution, then, would be to implement an independent secure boot procedure. As mentioned above, we are currently working on adding this feature in a future product.\nProduction (“self-destruct”) Mode Questions Q: When using the perimeter-detect feature, does the “self-destruct” mode work (destroy all of its key material) even when the Lock Tab hasn’t been cut? Expand for Answer A: Self-destruct mode works only after the Lock Tab has been cut.\nQ: Is there a way to turn off “self-destruct” mode? Expand for Answer A: No, once turned on, “self-destruct” mode is permanent.\nQ: If my HSM6 does “self-destruct,” can I create new keys and reuse the hardware? Expand for Answer The SBC and SD card hardware will be reusable. Because the SD card contents are encrypted and the decryption key was destroyed, the data is lost. The HSM6 will not be reusable because the key slots will be destroyed. Q: If I cut the Lock-Tab on a HSM6, can I move that HSM6 to another Pi or change the SD card? Expand for Answer A: No. Cutting the Lock-Tab permanently binds that instance of HSM6 to the specific instances of host computer and SD card. This is a security feature to prevent credentials being moved from one host to another. DO NOT cut the Lock-Tab if you are still in development and expect to change the host or SD cards.\nQ: Will HSM6 still self-destruct, even when my SBC is powered off? Expand for Answer A: Yes, because HSM6 is battery powered. As long as the battery is sufficiently charged, it will still self-destruct.\nOther Q: Where can I learn about and/or pre-order future products? Expand for Answer A: Sign up for our new product email updates at the bottom of Zymbit’s homepage.\nQ: Which SBCs are compatible with HSM6? Expand for Answer Electrically, the Zymkey-I2C will interface to any single board computer using I2C. Check compatibility with your particular Linux distribution. Raspberry Pi 3, 3B+, 4, Zero RPi Compute Module 3, 4 Q: Does HSM6 work with Arduino? Expand for Answer A: We have no plans to release an Arduino shield version. While we love Arduinos and use them all the time, they generally don’t have enough resources to handle cryptographic operations at this level.\nQ: Does HSM6 work with BeagleBone? Expand for Answer A: Zymbit does not officially support the BeagleBoard platform at this time.\nQ: Which operating systems does HSM6 support? Expand for Answer Q: How much power does HSM6 consume? Expand for Answer HSM6-RPi (3.3V): idle approx. 1mA; max active \u003c 25mA with LED off, \u003c 35mA with LED on. HSM6-USB (5V): idle approx. 1.5mA; max active \u003c 40mA with LEDs off, \u003c 60mA with LEDs on.

The 11/19 release can be downloaded from here: Pi5 Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64-bit 2024-11-19\nTo install Bootware on a PiZero2W running Bullseye64, you need to update the boot artifacts prior to installation. See instructions here.\nIt is highly recommended to use a Pi with at least 4GB of RAM. Bootware requires approximately 700MB of RAM overhead for image verification and encryption. For HTTPS endpoints, the image must be 700MB smaller than your total RAM.\nIssues and Notes August 2025 Ubuntu 24.04.3 (Released 8/7/25)\nThe Ubuntu team released 24.04.3 (updated Noble) on 8/7/25. The image straight from the Pi Imager can be used. There is no longer a need to use the daily image. 24.04.3 improves hardware support for the Pi5 and CM5. Ubuntu 24.04.3 works with Zymbit products on the platforms noted above (Pi5, CM5, Pi4, CM4). Bootware® 1.3.2-3\nBug fixes: #202: Pi5/CM5 with 16GB RAM are showing up as 8GB when booting from u-boot Bootware® 1.3.2-2\nBug fixes: #201: Adds Bootware support for Pi5 Rev 1.1 hardware. July 2025 Bootware® 1.3.2-1\nFeatures: #189: Add static network configuration option. See Advanced Networking Options for details. #190: Add ignore_low_ram=true flag. Ignores the low ram check in zboot to download images into the /DATA partition on devices that have less than 3GB RAM space. See Low Memory Platforms for details. NOTE: Zymbit recommends always using platforms with at least 4GB RAM. #191: Add feature to sync time from Zymbit HSM in zboot. Also add a flag to override, disable_cert_time_check=false. The new feature will try to sync the zboot system clock with the Zymbit HSM, whichever is later. If disable_cert_time_check=true and neither the zboot time nor the HSM time is reasonably current, a future time is set. This feature is included to cover situations where certificates need to be provided to bring up Wi-Fi interfaces, which will perform a system time verification before bringing up the wlan0 interface. Bug fixes: #197: Buildroot Wi-Fi related firmware added for all platforms. Prevented wlan0 from showing up in zboot for platforms running Ubuntu 22.04. #193: zbcli overrides existing wifi related config values with defaults on some parameters. If the user Save and Exits the zbcli update-config menu without touching the wifi related parameters, existing wifi configs would be overriden with defaults. The default values turned off wifi and set the psk hash to an empty string. zbcli now only changes wifi configs when the user touches the wifi configs in the zbcli update-config menu. #194: dhcp or ntp timeout defaults were too long. By default both dhcp and ntp retried up to 30 times at possibly a minute a interval, which could have a user sitting at a screen for 30min - 1 hr. Reduced timeouts to 3 retries. Open bugs: #196: overlay .zi images saves files as root regardless of what it was owned by before. #195: If you delete the DATA partition with your update policy not set to BOTH, zboot does not inject the new data key into the non-updated partition’s initramfs. If the user switches to the non-updated partition, the data key will return bad passphrase from initramfs. The system will timeout, boot up, and unlock the partition’s LUKS volume. Access to the shared LUKS data partition will be unavailable. April 2025 Bootware® 1.3.1-2\nBug fixes: #188: `sudo zbcli update-config –update-endpoint https://192.168.42.125/my.zi –update-endpoint-cert myCert.crt doesn’t work. Endpoint certs now work. #187: Bootware: --data-part-size-mb doesn’t apply correctly. Now works either interactively or non-interactively. March 2025 Bootware® 1.3.1-1\nFeatures: #182 Add support for Pi Zero 2W (ZYMKEY, HSM4, HSM6) Bookworm 64 bit and Bullseye 64 bit Uses the DATA partition as an alternative for Pis with limited RAM, like the Pi Zero 2W. Slight optimizations on Update writes to the encrypted A/B partitions. #184 zbcli update has a new --no-pre-verify flag. Normally the zi image is verified in userspace and also within zboot. Setting the --no-pre-verify flags skips the verify of the image/endpoint in userspace before launching into zboot, which saves some time. The images are always verified in zboot. WARNING: Setting this flag can lead to lost data, as the verification in zboot may require reformatting to make space for URL endpoints on limited RAM devices. #185 Additional information is logged in /boot/zboot.log. Bug fixes: #180: Bootware: zbcli update hostname/password cannot contain an @ character. February 2025 Bootware® 1.3.0-1\nBootware 1.3.0-1 requires updated images. zi images made with 1.2.2-1 or earlier will not work with 1.3.0-1, due to additional signature files in the 1.3.0-1 based images used for secondary verification step. Procedure for updating an image made with 1.2.2-1 or earlier:\nStart with Bootware 1.2.2 installed on staging device. Update staging device with existing 1.2.2 zi image. Update staging device with Bootware 1.3.0-1 Create a new updated zi image with Bootware 1.3.0-1 Release 1.2.2-1 (December 2024) Incorporates fixes from 1.2.0. There are no known open issues in 1.2.2 at this time. Release 1.2.0-30 (September 2024) Issue #168: Correction for change in latest Bookworm 11/19 update. /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf switched to MODULES=dep, which ended up not including all necessary modules in initramfs images. Bootware will change back to MODULES=most prior to creating images. Release 1.2.0-29 Issue #167: Syncing salt with the root filesystem after bootware update. Applies to Production Mode only.\nBootware update in zboot doesn’t sync up the good salt file to the root filesystem after a full image update. When the device is put into Production Mode, it will reject bad salt files, and stop regenerating new ones. When the root filesystem doesn’t have the correct salt file, it causes multiple errors for Production Mode.\nThe ZYMKEY will generate a salt (created from atecc id, rpi cpu id, memory id) in zkifc. The ZYMKEY’s ATECC will store the latest salt. While in Developer Mode, provided the salt file is not null and is in the correct serial number folder in /var/lib/zymbit, it will accept the salt file for opening a session even if it doesn’t match the salt stored in the ATECC. In Production Mode, it will be very strict with salt checking.\nFor encrypted filesystems and Bootware, the salt needs to be synced up to be the same in userspace and the initramfs. The initramfs needs a correct salt to open a session to the ZYMKEY to decrypt the encrypted filesystems. If the ZYMKEY regenerates a new salt in userspace, then the one in the initramfs must be updated as well. Production Mode requires a match. Development Mode is lenient and will not error off.\nIn previous versions, if a user makes an image on a different Pi and ZYMKEY, then loads the image onto another Pi/ZYMKEY. The salt file will not match up after a full image update. zkifc in Developer Mode will act without errors; it will regenerate the salt file. In Production Mode, because the salt in initramfs is not updated, the next reboot will fail.\nRelease 1.2.0-28 Issue #166: zbcli imager excluded the create-initramfs script from /etc/zymbit/zboot/scripts. The change to fix Issue #165 (closed) moved create-iniramfs.sh out of the binary and back to the file system, meaning the imager now must include create-initramfs. Fixed in 1.2.0-28. Release 1.2.0-27 Issue #163: Bootware: 1.2.0 version string changed from 1.2.0-rc.26 to 1.2.0-27. Note: two small fixes included in the change.\n#164 Fix to allow https or http. #164 (closed) #165 Fix Rearranged how zbcli runs create-initramfs.sh from internally to filesystem (closed) Fixed Issue #145: Fixed in Bootware 1.2: Switching OS with Zymkey does not properly set GPIO WAKE PIN. For instance, if you install on Bookworm, the WAKE PIN is set at installation time to 516. If you then load a bullseye zi, bullseye with older kernels wants the WAKE PIN at 4. Bootware needs to take this into account. Workaround is to setup your Zymkey with the operating system you intend to use and create your Bootware zi image within that OS.\nIssue #147: Bootware: Needs to identify the kernel file to be loaded for custom kernels named something other than kernel8.img or vmlinuz. Needed for supporting custom kernel versions. Workaround is to copy or link your custom kernel to either kernel8.img for Raspberry Pi based OS, or vmlinuz for Ubuntu based OS.\nPre-installed SCM Operating Systems The SCM ships with a pre-installed with the following options for Operating System:\nRaspberry Pi OS Lite (bookworm 64bit) Raspberry Pi OS Lite (bullseye 64bit) Ubuntu Server LTS 22.04 (jammy 64bit) Notice The SCM pre-installed image is encrypted and cannot be replaced via rpiboot. Once Bootware is installed, Bootware can install new images based off Bookworm, Bullseye or Jammy in the Zymbit zi image format. See the Getting Started section and the zbcli update tool.\nImportant: The CM4/SCM firmware must include bootloader version 2023/01/11 or later in order to work with Ubuntu 22.04. The version can be verified with the vcgencmd bootloader_version command. The firmware is not field upgradeable. If you have a CM4/SCM with an earlier version of the bootloader and need to run Ubuntu 22.04, please contact support@zymbit.com.\nPrecautions Important boot files to not delete.\nBoot.scr zboot.enc u-boot.bin config.txt [After bootware update] usr-kernel.enc [Before bootware] cmdline.txt [Before bootware] kernel8.img for rpiOS and vmlinuz for ubuntu The /boot filesystem should be partitioned for 512MB of space or more.

Procedure for updating an image made with 1.2.2-1 or earlier:\nStart with Bootware 1.2.2 installed on staging device. Update staging device with existing 1.2.2 zi image. Update staging device with Bootware 1.3.0-1 Create a new updated zi image with Bootware 1.3.0-1 Release 1.2.2-1 Incorporates fixes from 1.2.0. There are no known open issues in 1.2.2 at this time. Release 1.2.0-30 Issue #168: Correction for change in latest Bookworm 11/19 update. /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf switched to MODULES=dep, which ended up not including all necessary modules in initramfs images. Bootware will change back to MODULES=most prior to creating images. Release 1.2.0-29 Issue #167: Syncing salt with the root filesystem after bootware update. Applies to Production Mode only.\nBootware update in zboot doesn’t sync up the good salt file to the root filesystem after a full image update. When the device is put into Production Mode, it will reject bad salt files, and stop regenerating new ones. When the root filesystem doesn’t have the correct salt file, it causes multiple errors for Production Mode.\nThe ZYMKEY will generate a salt (created from atecc id, rpi cpu id, memory id) in zkifc. The ZYMKEY’s ATECC will store the latest salt. While in Developer Mode, provided the salt file is not null and is in the correct serial number folder in /var/lib/zymbit, it will accept the salt file for opening a session even if it doesn’t match the salt stored in the ATECC. In Production Mode, it will be very strict with salt checking.\nFor encrypted filesystems and Bootware, the salt needs to be synced up to be the same in userspace and the initramfs. The initramfs needs a correct salt to open a session to the ZYMKEY to decrypt the encrypted filesystems. If the ZYMKEY regenerates a new salt in userspace, then the one in the initramfs must be updated as well. Production Mode requires a match. Development Mode is lenient and will not error off.\nIn previous versions, if a user makes an image on a different Pi and ZYMKEY, then loads the image onto another Pi/ZYMKEY. The salt file will not match up after a full image update. zkifc in Developer Mode will act without errors; it will regenerate the salt file. In Production Mode, because the salt in initramfs is not updated, the next reboot will fail.\nRelease 1.2.0-28 Issue #166: zbcli imager excluded the create-initramfs script from /etc/zymbit/zboot/scripts. The change to fix Issue #165 (closed) moved create-iniramfs.sh out of the binary and back to the file system, meaning the imager now must include create-initramfs. Fixed in 1.2.0-28.

For instance, if you install on Bookworm, the WAKE PIN is set at installation time to 516. If you then load a bullseye zi, bullseye with older kernels wants the WAKE PIN at 4.

Bootware 1.2.2 supports various Raspberry Pi computers and requires a Zymbit HSM or SCM to run. Bootware takes advantage of security features of various Zymbit products and protects credentials via the HSM.\nIf you want to jump right in, Click here to Get Started! What is Bootware? Bootware is full-featured native OS switcher/manager with first rate support for encrypted root and data partitions. Bootware is not a hypervisor.\nBootware supports both manual and automatic rollback between A and B installations. If rollback fails, Bootware is able to enter recovery to reload one of the installations from either a local image or a remote secure endpoint.\nBootware works with 64-bit versions of Raspberry Pi OS and Ubuntu on Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 and the various compute module variants.\nBootware is not an OS, therefore custom OS builds are generally supported. For larger orders, Zymbit is able to offer device programming and image validation services of custom user OS builds.\nBootware is not an IoT cloud stack, and interoperates well with most popular stacks. Bootware manages the relationship between bare metal and OS installations as simply, securely, and robustly as possible.\nBootware correctly handles potentially conflicting sets of kernels and boot artifacts, allowing for major kernel upgrades to occur without undue distress.\nBootware fully isolates bootable root partitions with separate sets of LUKS credentials, which are securely injected into user s OS initramfs images. Bootware supports a shared data partition, for which the credentials are distributed to new installations. Each new installation gets a clean new set of keys and one root partition cannot access the other.\nNew installations are deployed from within Bootware’s secure enclave, zboot, which boots straight via secure boot. zboot is able to download, validate, and deploy updates without relying on a potentially compromised OS installation to install the next new clean image.\nBootware has a robust workflow for update signing, which may use either hardware or software key options. Update signing occurs on a dedicated publishing node.\nBootware uses full image forklift updates for major OS installations. Partial overlay updates are also supported, and may be installed directly from user mode.\nBootware runs of top of Zymbit’s security services package, which is required to use Zymbit security hardware.\nBootware has additional integrations with Zymbit Secure Edge Nodes, which may be purchased to development and production use, or may be used as reference designs for custom hardware. For highly secure products, such as Secure Compute Modules, Bootware is almost essential in order to apply updates without the ability to use Pi burner tools, which are intentionally disabled.\nBootware installation locations: Bootware secure uboot and the secure enclave, zboot, along with encrypted configurations files are installed in into /boot.\nBootware uses Zymbit LUKS initramfs unlock code already present in standard Zymbit driver package, but will inject credentials before encrypting the initramfs together with the kernel and boot artifacts into an immutable boot image for secure uboot.\nBootware installs zbcli and Bootware scripts into user OS. User must ensure that these packages are present in user images to be deployed using Bootware. User mode tools manage Bootware settings and check for updates on USB drives or on remote endpoints. zbcli also allows user to trigger manual rollback and update installations. Once a suitable update is located, Bootware reboots into zboot to install.\nBootware boot sequence: For Zymbit Secure Compute Modules only, supervisor-based pre-boot environment validates and repairs /boot partition. Zymkey and HSM products do not have this feature.\nPi ROM code boots and loads standard Pi artifacts.\nZymbit uboot loads\nIf user boot is to proceed normally:\nUboot loads, decrypts, and validates boot package for the active boot partition. The package includes everything required to boot that installation inclusive of kernel, initramfs, args, device tree objects, etc.\nBoot counter is incremented and control is passed to the kernel.\nOnce in initramfs, zbunlock is invoked to connect to the HSM and to decrypt LUKS credentials that have been previously injected into initramfs. /root is mounted.\nOnce boot is complete, boot counter is reset. If the boot fails, and the system reboots for whichever reason, the process repeats with boot counter incrementing.\nIf the boot counter has exceeded the threshold, rollback occurs:\nUboot loads zboot to switch to the backup partition\nSystem reboots\nUboot attempts to boot the backup boot partition in the same way it boots the active partition.\nOnce boot is complete, boot counter is reset. If the boot fails, and the system reboots for whichever reason, the process repeats with boot counter incrementing.\nIf the boot counter for the backup partition also exceeds the threshold without a successful boot, the system enters recovery mode:\nUboot loads zboot.\nZboot attempts to locate an image to install either on a local USB drive or on a known remote endpoint.\nIf the image is found, it is installed, and then the system is rebooted into it. All images are checked for correct signatures before applying them to the system.\nIf the image is not found, zboot enters console interactive mode and asks for endpoint information. Any image to be installed must have a proper signature.\nBootware is designed with the singular goal to ensure that properly validated and installed image is booted successfully on user’s machine.\nLinks to Bootware 1.2.2 Documentation Sections ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Bootware is a secure integrated tool for managing multiple Linux OS …","ref":"/bootware1.3.2/archive/bootware1.2.2/","tags":"","title":"Bootware 1.2.2"},{"body":" Troubleshooting tips and FAQ Modifications from Standard Raspberry Pi OS Lite The SCM ships with a pre-installed with the following options for Operating System:\nRaspberry Pi OS Lite (bookworm 64bit) Raspberry Pi OS Lite (bullseye 64bit) Ubuntu Server LTS 22.04 (jammy 64bit) Notice The pre-installed image is encrypted and cannot be replaced via rpiboot.

Workaround is to setup your Zymkey with the operating system you intend to use and create your Bootware zi image within that OS.\nIssue #147: Bootware: Needs to identify the kernel file to be loaded for custom kernels named something other than kernel8.img or vmlinuz. Needed for supporting custom kernel versions. Workaround is to copy or link your custom kernel to either kernel8.img for Raspberry Pi based OS, or vmlinuz for Ubuntu based OS.\nChanges to our standard images The table below summarizes changes made to the standard image.\nDefault As Shipped Boot partition of 256MB 2x Boot partition size - 512MB Console login allowed Disabled SSH optionally enabled SSH with password allowed Hostname is raspberrypi Hostname changed to zymbit-dev Default user of pi Default user is zymbit.

Bootware 1.1 adds support for the ZYMKEY across additional platforms. The following matrix of platforms and Operating Systems support Bootware™:\nPlatform Zymbit Module OS Support CM4 SCM Bookworm 64-bit, Bullseye 64-bit, Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy) CM4 ZYMKEY4 Bookworm 64-bit, Bullseye 64-bit, Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy) Pi4 ZYMKEY4 Bookworm 64-bit, Bullseye 64-bit, Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy) Other significant enhancements in Bootware 1.1: Issue #142 - OS updates that change boot.scr can prevent future boot. Affects Ubuntu. Although the Pi version of Ubuntu does not use U-Boot, Ubuntu’s dpkg kernel update re-writes the file /boot/firmware/boot.scr. boot.scr was used by Bootware 1.0, and a re-write of the file could leave the system unable to boot. Bootware 1.1 no longer relies on the file.\nEnhancement - Bootware 1.1 now includes a common data partition of 512MB. The common data partition is encrypted and the LUKS key (shared by A and B) is locked by the Zymbit HSM.\nTo get started with Bootware, you should have your plaform OS installed and the Zymbit SCM up and running. For our example images, the default hostname is zymbit-dev and the default login is zymbit with a password of zymbit. We recommend you change those during your development process.\nFor any Bootware image, the Pi RAM must exceed the size of the zi image. We recommend the Pi have at least 4MB RAM.\nIt is also recommended to have an HDMI console attached when using Bootware. The process of repartitioning and populating partitions can take substantial time, upwards of 45 minutes and the console serves as a point of reference of activity.\nMore information on Bootware from zymbit.com Bootware 1.1 User’s Guide and Information ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Bootware 1.1: General Platform Release Bootware™ is a set of software …","ref":"/bootware1.3.2/archive/bootware-one-zero-general/","tags":"","title":"Bootware 1.1 General (deprecated)"},{"body":"Updated: 2022-02-14\nWhat is SLIP39 and Shamir’s Backup? An algorithm created by Adi Shamir coined Shamir’s Secret Sharing, provides a new way of backing up and recovering our private keys. This algorithm was proposed by SatoshiLabs to be accepted as new backup method for wallet keys and thus named SLIP39.\nWhy use SLIP39 recovery? If you are familiar with current wallets like MetaMask and Ledger, then you will notice that most of these wallets implement a backup strategy using BIP39. BIP39 is a 12 or 24 word unique sentence that can recreate private keys backed by this strategy . But this is only one shard, and puts responsibility on the owner to keep this one shard from falling into the wrong hands.\nSLIP39 allows the owner to backup their wallets with multiple shards using a committee-like approach. For example, we can generate 10 shards and require that 6 of these shards need to be present to recover a wallet. If the owner loses one shard to a thief then it becomes less of a concern as the thief would still need 5 other shards to get into the wallet. Furthermore the owner can store these 10 shards however he wants: give a shard to a friend, store a shard in safe, bury a shard in the backyard, etc.\nMaximum number of shards? SLIP39 generates groups and each of these groups can contain its own system of member shards.\nHSM6 supports up to 14 groups * 14 members per group = 196 shards total SCM supports up to 16 groups * 16 members per group = 256 shards total Useful Resources: SLIP39 Prerequisites Zymbit Modules that support this feature:\nHSM6 SCM Follow the Getting Started guide first, installing all Zymbit Driver Package.\nAll code snippets written in this article are written using python3. For more Zymbit API documentation (Python/C/C++) visit: API Documentation\nGenerating a master seed with SLIP39 recovery The next steps cover how to create a master seed and setup for recovery of the seed with SLIP39. The example python code is provided in its entirety at the end of the explaination of each portion of the code.\nOpening a master seed SLIP39 generating session Create the recovery strategy. The recovery strategy will detail the number of groups to track (group_count) and number of groups needed to recover the master seed (group_threshold).\niteration_exponent dictates how many hashes are done at cryptographic layer (takes integer 0-5). The higher this number is, the longer (exponentially) the module will take to churn out a shard.\nvariant is only for curve “ed25519”, we support the “cardano” variant for ed25519. Otherwise is empty string.\nSupported Curves Other supported variants Nistp256/Secp256r1 None Secp256k1 None Ed25519 Cardano passphrase is the password for generating/recovering the master generator key.\nuse_SLIP39_recovery = zymkey.RecoveryStrategySLIP39(group_count = 3, group_threshold = 2, iteration_exponent = 0, variant = \"\", passphrase = \"\") Next, start the shard generating SLIP39 session.\n# The master seed will not be generated until all groups are created.

Return Code:%i\" % (return_code)) A return code of 0 means we successfully started an active SLIP39 session.\nWarning While a SLIP39 session is active for both generation or recovery, other wallet generation functions are locked up. This means we can’t generate other keys while a SLIP39 session. If anything ever goes wrong in the SLIP39 process, we can cancel an active SLIP39 session at any time.\n# cancel an active SLIP39 session (Generation/Recovery) zymkey.client.cancel_SLIP39_session() Setting up our Groups and their member shards Groups can also contain their own member shard system. We will need to set this configuration for each group we work on with set_gen_SLIP39_group_info. The group_index is the group id we will be working on. So if we asked for 3 groups in our recovery strategy, then the group indexes for these 3 groups are [0,1,2].\nThe member_count is the number of shards in the group.\nThe member_threshold is the number of member shards we required to reconstruct the group.\nadd_gen_SLIP39_member_pwd(string passphrase) will return a -1 and 33 word mnemonic sentence (shard). If we specified a member_count of three, then we will need to call this function 3 times to generate our 3 member shards. By default the function doesn’t attach a password to any of these shards. This function will return a -1 until all groups/members are generated.\nFor now, the first group will have 3 shards with a threshold of 2 shards required for reconstruction. These shards will also not have passwords attached to them.\n# First Group has been divided into three members.

To show that we do not have to always shard up our groups into multiple shards. Since this is the last group in the SLIP39 session, the master seed key’s slot number will be returned on the last shard generated by add_gen_SLIP39_member_pwd() instead of -1.\nWarning Although this shard may look like a BIP39 mnemonic sentence.

The module will return -1 until it successfully recreates all groups needed to generate the master key. If an incorrect shard is fed in, then it will still return -1. Remember we can always call cancel_SLIP39_session to stop our active SLIP39 session, if an incorrect shard is fed in.\n# Feed in the shards.

An algorithm …","ref":"/tutorials/digital-wallet/slip39-example/","tags":"","title":"SLIP39 and Shamir's Wallet Recovery Example"},{"body":"Applicable Products The information included in this post applies to ZYMKEY4, HSM4, and HSM6.\nStandard ZYMKEY4 and HSMs are supplied with a Real Time Clock (RTC). This capability can be useful for platforms which do not have a built-in RTC, such as Raspberry Pi, but rather depend on NTP for time-keeping.\nDependence on NTP may cause problems due to unscheduled power outages or unreliable WiFi connections. For example, if a deployed application that periodically collects sensor data experiences a power outage and is not able to restore a connection to any available networks upon boot up, the timestamps associated with any collected data would be incorrect. On Raspberry Pi, this will be approximate to the last valid timestamp when things were last running normally.\nWe can simulate this by disabling ntp.service comparing the system date to the time.nist.gov server. After only 12 hours, the system clock has drifted nearly 40 minutes!\nZymkey and HSM’s Real Time Clock is battery backed for reliable operation, which could be very valuable for significant power or network outages. Prior to starting NTP in the boot sequence, the Zymkey or HSM provides the current UTC timestamp to the host computer (e.g. Raspberry Pi). This means that, if access to a reliable network isn’t available, a reliable timestamp will be available for use by any running applications.\nWith a bound Zymbit Security Module installed and running zkbootrtc.service on the same system as above (ntp disabled), we can see the clock restored based on the Zymbit Security Module’s RTC. You will notice this message at boot:\nFeb 8 19:22:26 raspberrypi systemd[1]: Starting Restore System Clock from Zymkey… Feb 9 18:58:48 raspberrypi systemd[1]: Started Restore System Clock from Zymkey.\nAnd we can validate using the same test as above.\nThe time value is not settable directly by applications that are running on Pi. Instead RTC accuracy is monitored and maintained by the software suite.\nIn order for the RTC feature to be activated, the Zymkey/ HSM needs to have it’s clock checked and set occasionally, which is done by the HSM software, but this means that NTP must be running so that the Pi time is synchronized to an accurate clock source. To make sure that NTP is active, on later raspbian distributions, you’ll need to run sudo timedatectl set-ntp true and then reboot. In the case where a new coin cell has been installed, it may take a few minutes after the reboot for the HSM time to be synchronized.\nAccuracy of RTC ZYMKEY4 and HSMs with integrated RTC are supplied with Standard Accuracy calibration. This is generally suitable for commercial applications that are not exposed to extreme temperature ranges and not disconnected from NTP for months on end. (see specs below)\nAn optional High Accuracy RTC is available, providing additional stability over extended temperature ranges.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Applicable Products The information included in this post applies to …","ref":"/reference/real-time-clock/","tags":"","title":"Real Time Clock Operation"},{"body":" Bootware Image files available for download Example images all have the hostname of zymbit-dev and a login of zymbit and a password of zymbit.

This is a uboot issue but it affects bootware during kernel/os upgrades that include device tree changes. It is highly likely that a device tree area change can leave the system in an unbootable state. u-boot will fail with a “Flattened Device Tree” error and fail to boot. This has been fixed in Preview 2.1 (01092024). zboot version in green will read 0.3.1. Bootware Preview has been updated to include the fix for this issue, along with the example image.\nBOOTWARE PREVIEW FEATURE SET (October 2023) Bootware Preview is designed for customers to do the following: Transfer a Raspberry Pi CM4 image to an SCM Replicate an SCM “golden image” to other SCMs Store an original golden image in one eMMC partition plus a copy for development in a second partition, allowing regression to the original golden image at will To achieve this functionality, Bootware Preview provides the following new SCM functionality: The ability to make and update two partitions (A/B), managed by a partition supervisor called zboot. A zboot methodology to load (and subsequently reload) the A/B partitions from a USB or a URL endpoint The ability to manually select to boot from one partition or the other. Initial tools and scripts for creating and loading images into the A/B partitions. Automatic rollback and recovery of A/B partitions. Important Bootware Preview Restrictions Two partitions (A/B) are supported. A shared data partition is not included in the Preview. In an A/B partition layout, the maximum SCM partition size is 14.4 GB. Images larger than 14.4 GB should not be attempted. Only load SCM or CM4 images that have been tested. The Preview unit cannot recover if it cannot access the zboot bootloader. “bare metal recovery” is not included in the Preview. The Zymbit SCM uses its own/boot/config.txt that both enables zboot and the dwc2 driver. Do not enable otg_mode in config.txt. USB storage devices most likely require a powered hub when using the Zymbit Secure Edge Node or Zymbit Dev IO board. Failure to do so may result in the SCM rebooting. Only Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye64-based images are supported by the Preview. For other images, please contact Zymbit for verification Image security features are not enabled in the Preview release. Secure image rollback and recovery features will be implemented in the final release. Using zboot - Hardened Zymbit boot utility Zboot is Zymbit’s boot utility included with Bootware that pulls and reflashes a device with a new user image. In the current Preview, the image can be downloaded two ways:\nover the network via https from a USB storage device Warning The current Preview of zboot does not have bare metal recovery. The boot process must make it at least to zboot in order to take action to recover. Getting Started - Download and Install Bootware Software Download the Bootware software to the SCM. The Bootware software can be downloaded with curl:\ncurl https://zk-sw-repo.s3.amazonaws.com/ota_preview/zymbit-ota-preview.tgz --output zymbit-ota-preview.tgz Once the tar file is downloaded, untar:\ntar xvzf zymbit-ota-preview.tgz The contents will be extracted into zymbit-ota-preview/. Files extracted:\nItem Description install_zboot_tools.sh Shell script to install zboot tools scripts/ Scripts and configuration files for zboot zboot_artifacts/ zboot executable and boot artifacts Run the following install script on the SCM to install the zboot utilities:\ncd zymbit-ota-preview sudo ./install_zboot_tools.sh Installing zboot tools... Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree... Done … Installing zboot... Done! After installing the zboot tools. A reboot is required. Reboot now? (Y/n) Reboot to complete the installation process. Once completed, all necessary files required for loading new images via zboot will be installed.\nInstalling and running zboot to reflash an image zboot requires images in a particular format unique to zboot. An image conversion tool is provided. Input images can be either complete binary images of your entire eMMC or tarballs of your /boot and /rootfs partitions. NOTE: This does not have to be done on the running device. The script can be run on any workstation.\nIf you would like to get started with a sample image, we’ve converted the base image installed on the SCM for the preview to a zboot format. Otherwise, continue on to create your own image. Our example image can be downloaded from here, or you can use the URL as a valid endpoint to load a known good image:\ncurl https://zk-sw-repo.s3.amazonaws.com/ota_preview/base_preview.zi --output base_preview.zi The script used to convert to a zboot image is:\nzymbit-image-converter [ test.img | {-b \u003cboot.tar\u003e -r \u003croot.tar} | -z ] [-o \u003cdirectory\u003e ] test.img\tBinary image file of eMMC (e.g. created from dd). Name of output image need not match. -b\t\u003cboot.tar\u003e Use this boot tarball as input. Must include -r option. -r \u003croot.tar\u003e Use this root tarball as input. Must include -b option. -o \u003cdirectory\u003e Output directory for new .zi image. -z Creates a zi image from your current running root file system. Examples of Image conversions: Example to create a zi image from your current running root file system sudo zymbit-image-converter -z Item Description Name of Image?: base_preview Name of the converted output file. A zi extension will be added to the name. The name does not need to match the name given on the command line. Version?: 2.1 An arbitrary version number for your reference. Example to convert a binary image file (created from dd if=/dev/sda bs=4M of=my.img): sudo zymbit-image-converter my.img The script will prompt for information:\nItem Description Name of Image?: base_preview Name of the converted output file. A zi extension will be added to the name. The name does not need to match the name given on the command line. Version?: 2.1 An arbitrary version number for your reference. Boot File System Partition Number? (EX: 1): 1 Partition number of boot filesystem in binary image file. Must be provided; no default. Root File System Partition Number? (EX: 2): 2 Partition number of root filesystem in binary image file. Must be provided; no default. The script extracts the boot/root tarballs of the binary image. It will then packages it up in a Zymbit image and output it to:\n/etc/zymbit/zboot/update_artifacts/output/base_preview.zi\nExample to convert boot/root tarballs (created from tar cvf my_boot.tar \u003cboot_part\u003e, tar cvf my_rfs.tar \u003croot_part\u003e) You will need to provide the names and paths to your tarballs. Run the script:\nsudo zymbit-image-converter -b ./boot.tar -r ./root.tar The script will prompt for information:\nItem Description Name of Image?: base_preview Name of the converted output file. A zi extension will be added to the name. Version?: 2.1 An arbitrary version number for your reference. The script extracts the boot/root tarballs of the binary image. It will then package it up in a Zymbit image and output it to:\n/etc/zymbit/zboot/update_artifacts/output/base_preview.zi\nPut the .zi image from the script on a server or USB drive for download. Zboot downloads images from either a USB storage device or the internet via curl requests.\nUse the Bootware Wizard to Configure your System Bootware Preview includes a a tool to help configure your system called zb-wizard. zb-wizard is meant to set your device environment up for pulling down updates from a configured endpoint and the update policies for how to apply those updates. Bootware recommends update policies with A/B schema to have a stable backup partition for rollback. To start the wizard,\nsudo zb-wizard Choose your settings as described below.\nBootware Wizard -Main Screen Choose your options, save and exit.\nPartition Setup – Specifies the device partition layout after an update. The root file system will be re-partitioned with your chosen configuration. Filesystem sizes estimates are based off of 32GB CM4s.\n1 A Only [HALF DISK] – This will take the remaining disk space available after the boot partition and create an encrypted partition that will use half of this space as the root partition (around 14.4 GB). This leaves half the disk empty on purpose for dev usage.\n2 A only [FULL DISK] – This will take the remaining disk space available after the boot partition (around ~29GB) and create an encrypted partition that will use almost all of this space as the root partition.\n3 A/B – RECOMMENDED This will take the remaining disk space available after the boot partition and create two encrypted partitions, each taking up half of the remaining space (around 14.4 GB). Most useful for rollback and recovery with an Active/Backup configuration.\nUpdate Policy – The update policies are centered around how a new update gets applied to the filesystems on the device. The update policies listed below are only related to (A)ctive/(B)ackup partitioned devices, as (A)ctive only devices only have one filesystem to update.\n1 Backup – RECOMMENDED Apply new updates to current backup filesystem and swap to booting the new updated backup partition as the active partition now. If the new update is bad, it will rollback into the previous stable active partition. Only relevant when configured with A/B partitions.\n2 Active – Apply new updates to only the current active filesystem and keep the backup partition untouched. Only relevant when configured with A/B partitions.\n3 Both – Apply new updates to both filesystems and always boot on the first root partition as the active partition. Warning: A bad update will have nothing to rollback to; the device will have to go through a recovery process.\nEndpoint Setup – The configured endpoint ready with a new update(.zi image). The endpoint can be either an https URL or an external mass storage device like a USB stick.\nEndpoint – Type the endpoint where the .zi image resides for the device to pull updates from. The endpoint will be checked for validity.\nExample https URL: https://zk-sw-repo.s3.amazonaws.com/ota_preview/base_preview.zi Example USB stick: /dev/sda1\nWireless Setup – Bootware supports pulling updates via Wifi or LAN connections. Wifi credentials need to be provided in order for bootware to access the wifi during updates. If no wireless credentials are provided, the wireless interface is disabled in zboot.\nSSID - Provide the Wifi SSID Passphrase - Provide the Wifi passphrase Save and Exit. You may also choose to Revert to the default configuration.\nUse zboot to Install the New Image Once you have completed using the Wizard to configure your Bootware, run zboot-install-new-update to complete the process by repartitioning and loading your image.\nsudo zboot-install-new-update The script will show your configuration for review and confirmation, or give you the option to change the configuration. This method can be used as an alternative to using the Wizaard.\nzboot-install-new-update Review and continue for zboot update\nThe script will prompt for a reboot to complete the process.\nzboot Boot Process The Zboot process will now take place.\nWarning The initial configuration process can take up to 45 minutes to complete. The process can be completed via ssh, but an HDMI console is helpful to follow the process. During the process, the blue LED will be OFF. On the console, you will see:\n“Loading: Encrypted zboot please wait…” message, which takes around 4-5min. The A/B partitions will be configured and setup for LUKS encryption protected by the Zymbit SCM It will then take a few minutes to get/unpack tarballs from the image. It will take some time to unpack the image into the A/B root partitions - approximately 7 minutes, each. Once it’s done unpacking the image to the A and B partitions, it will boot into the updated ACTIVE partition. You can use lsblk to examine the partitions. Reload all utilities The Bootware utilities are needed for Bootware to function. If not included in your newly loaded image, you will need to load the utilities into your partition(s). Our example zi file base_preview.zi has the Bootware Utilities pre-loaded.\nRecovery Each successful boot will clear a max_boot_failure counter. A max_boot_failure count of 3 will trigger the recovery mechanism. The BACKUP partition will become the ACTIVE partition. If neither can boot, the endpoint with a good image will be loaded. A ROLLOVER notification message will be added to the MOTD.\nForce Failover (Change Active/Backup partitions) A failover from Active to Backup is done with the -r option to zboot-install-new-update\nsudo zboot-install-new-update -r Uninstall Bootware A utility is included to uninstall bootware, returning to the standard linux boot process. The uninstall process will leave you in the current encrypted active partition and preserve the contents of that partion as well as the overall partition layout.\ncd ~/zymbit-ota-preview sudo ./uninstall_zboot.sh The script will confirm you would like to uninstall the bootware scripts and artifacts, as well as a required reboot.\nAdditional Information and Support Contact Support\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" Notice Bootware 1.0 GA Release is now available.\nBootware Preview is …","ref":"/bootware1.3.2/archive/bootware-preview/","tags":"","title":"Bootware Preview (deprecated)"},{"body":"Updated: 2022-02-22\nWhat is an oversight wallet? The zymbit oversight wallet is a read-only wallet. In the world of blockchain, accounts and the funds associated with them are public and able to be viewed. This is done by looking up the blockchain address associated with public keys. Read-only or receive-only wallets can’t send funds/assets out of the account. To send funds an account must be able to sign a fund transaction with a private key. So the oversight wallet is a wallet that doesn’t contain private keys, just the public key counterparts.\nWhy use oversight wallet? This can be useful for handing a copy of a wallet to a financial advisor or someone of a similar role. They would be able to track the history of that wallet, but wouldn’t have any power in changing the wallet in any kind of way.\nPrerequisites Zymbit Modules that support this feature:\nHSM6 SCM Follow the Getting Started guide first, installing all Zymbit Driver Package.\nAll code snippets written in this article are written using Python3. For more Zymbit API documentation (Python/C/C++) visit: API Documentation\nCreating an oversight wallet on the Zymbit module First create an example BIP32 master seed wallet as a reference for our oversight wallet.\n# Create our BIP32 master seed print(\"Create our normal wallet...\") master_seed_slot = zymkey.client.gen_wallet_master_seed(key_type = \"secp256k1\", master_gen_key = \"\", wallet_name = MyExampleWallet) print(\"Done! Master seed slot:%i\" % (master_seed_slot)) Next for this example, we create children keys and derive a wallet address “m/44/60/0/0’”. An oversight wallet is created by referencing the public key and chain code of the last hardened node of a wallet address. So in this example, grab the public key and chain code from the slot of the \" 0’ \" index.\n# Oversight wallet requires the public key and chain code of the last hardened node in a wallet address. # So for this example will use m/44/60/0/0' where the 0' is the last hardened node for our oversight wallet to start from. print(\"\\nCreate a wallet derivation path m/44/60/0/0' ..\") child_slot = zymkey.client.gen_wallet_child_key(parent_key_slot = master_seed_slot, index = 44, hardened = False) child_slot = zymkey.client.gen_wallet_child_key(parent_key_slot = child_slot, index = 60, hardened = False) child_slot = zymkey.client.gen_wallet_child_key(parent_key_slot = child_slot, index = 0, hardened = False) # Let's return the chain code of this hardened node to generate our oversight wallet later child_slot, chain_code = zymkey.client.gen_wallet_child_key(parent_key_slot = child_slot, index = 0, hardened = True, return_chain_code = True) hardened_node_pub_key = zymkey.client.get_public_key(child_slot) print(\"Done! m/44/60/0/0' slot:%i\" % (child_slot)) Now generate an oversight wallet from the public key and chain code:\n# Using the public key and chain code, create the oversight wallet. # Note that the oversight wallet can exist at the same time as our BIP32 wallet, but needs a different wallet name, as wallet names are unique. print(\"Create our oversight wallet...\") oversight_slot = zymkey.client.gen_oversight_wallet(key_type = \"secp256k1\", pub_key = hardened_node_pub_key, chain_code = chain_code, node_addr = \"m/44/60/0/0'\", wallet_name = \"Oversight_wallet\") print(\"Done! oversight_slot slot:%i\" % (oversight_slot)) The oversight wallet can generate child keys the same way as a normal BIP32 wallet. However this wallet contains no private keys, so no transaction will be able to be signed properly.\nAlso note that this oversight wallet starts from the \" 0’ \" index of the previous wallet. It has no insight about the “m/44/60/0” key pairs that came before it.\nFull Code Example #!/usr/bin/python3 import zymkey # -----------------------------Create a oversight wallet example------------------------------------------------------------- wallet_name = \"MyExampleWallet\" # Create our BIP32 master seed print(\"Create our normal wallet...\") master_seed_slot = zymkey.client.gen_wallet_master_seed(key_type = \"secp256k1\", master_gen_key = \"\", wallet_name=wallet_name) print(\"Done!

PAY ATTENTION TO THE FOLLOWING:\nIf you are using the Perimeter Detect features, then the sequence in which you arm and disarm this feature is very important. Be sure to carefully follow the process steps below.

If your SCM’s action mode is set to self_destruct, you might render your unit useless while attempting to activate Production Mode.\nResources Perimeter Detect: SCM Understand how to use the SCM’s perimeter detect features. View resource To do this quickly, with the SCM client libraries installed, you can run the following shell command to use the Python API to communicate with the SCM and set the Perimeter Event Actions to only Notify when triggered:\npython3 -c \"import zymkey; for ch in (0, 1): zymkey.client.set_perimeter_event_actions(ch, action_notify=True, action_self_destruct=False) zymkey.client.clear_perimeter_detect_info()\" Prepare your application You should then install your application on your host SBC.

If you encounter a major issue with your application after your SCM has been permanently bound to your device and armed, you may not be able to fix it. Test the functionality of your application thoroughly to ensure it is free of major defects that will prevent it from functioning properly. In Production Mode when Perimeter Detect features are in use, it may be difficult to make significant changes to your configuration without locking youself out of the SCM, depending on the nature of your application and its configuration.\nActivate Production Mode To put the SCM into Production Mode only requires a function call followed by a power cycle.\nThe API function lock_binding puts the SCM into Production Mode.

View resource To reiterate, before you continue, the following steps should be complete:\nInstall a battery on the HSM4. Connect the GPIO header of the HSM4 to the GPIO pins of the host board while the host is powered down. Install HSM4 software on the host and establish temporary binding in development mode. After these steps have been completed, you are ready to prepare your device for permanent binding.\nPrepare Perimeter Detect The Perimeter Event Actions for your HSM4 should be set to none or notify only. If your HSM4’s action mode is set to selfdestruct, you might render your HSM4 useless while attempting to activate production mode.\nResources Perimeter Detect: HSM4 Understand how to use the HSM4’s perimeter detect features. View resource To do this quickly, with the HSM4 client libraries installed, you can run the following shell command to use the Python API to communicate with the HSM4 and set the Perimeter Event Actions to do nothing when triggered:\npython3 -c \"import zymkey; for ch in (0, 1): zymkey.client.set_perimeter_event_actions(ch, action_notify=False, action_self_destruct=False) zymkey.client.clear_perimeter_detect_info()\" Prepare your application If you intend to use your HSM4 to encrypt your root file system, you should complete that step now, using our guide. This step is highly recommended.\nResources Encrypting Root File System with Zymbit Security Modules Encrypt the root file system of your host device using LUKS and your HSM4.

Active production mode\nPermanently bind your HSM6 to the host device. Develop your application To begin, ensure that you have followed the Getting Started guide for your HSM6 carefully to install the prerequisite Zymbit Driver Package:\nResources HSM6 (legacy) Install your HSM6 to a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian or Ubuntu before moving to production mode. View resource To reiterate, before you continue, the following steps should be complete:\nInstall a battery on the HSM6. Connect the GPIO header of the HSM6 to the GPIO pins of the host board while the host is powered down. Install HSM6 software on the host and establish temporary binding in development mode. After these steps have been completed, you are ready to prepare your device for permanent binding.\nPrepare Perimeter Detect The Perimeter Event Actions for your HSM6 should be set to none or notify only. If your HSM6’s action mode is set to selfdestruct, you might render your HSM6 useless while attempting to activate production mode.\nResources Perimeter Detect: HSM6 Understand how to use the HSM6’s perimeter detect features. View resource To do this quickly, with the HSM6 client libraries installed, you can run the following shell command to use the Python API to communicate with the HSM6 and set the Perimeter Event Actions to do nothing when triggered:\npython3 -c \"import zymkey; for ch in (0, 1): zymkey.client.set_perimeter_event_actions(ch, action_notify=False, action_self_destruct=False) zymkey.client.clear_perimeter_detect_info()\" Prepare your application If you intend to use your HSM6 to encrypt your root file system, you should complete that step now, using our guide. This step is highly recommended.\nResources Encrypting Root File System with Zymbit Security Modules Encrypt the root file system of your host device using LUKS and your HSM6. View resource You should then install your application on your host SBC (in the encrypted volume, if applicable).\nTest, debug, and test again Danger DO NOT skip this step. If you encounter a major issue with your application after your HSM6 has been permanently bound to your device and armed, you may not be able to fix it. Test the functionality of your application thoroughly to ensure it is free of major defects that will prevent it from functioning properly. After the HSM6 has been bound to your host SBC, especially if Perimeter Detect features are in use, it may be difficult to make significant chances to your configuration without locking youself out of the HSM6, depending on the nature of your application and its configuration.\nActivate production mode With the Zymkey, a physical tab was cut to go into production mode.

Supervised Boot is Zymbit’s method for insuring that the boot process is secure. A list of files can be specifed to be hashed, signed, and verified by the SCM prior to allowing the CM4 module to boot. By default, the following files are signed and verified:\n/boot/bcm2711-rpi-cm4.dtb /boot/cmdline.txt /boot/config.txt /boot/initrd.img /boot/kernel8.img (or /boot/kernel7l.img for 32-bit) /boot/start4.elf /boot/zymbit_mac_address /boot/overlays/vc4-kms-v3d.dtbo The Manifest The Manifest is the list of files that will be tracked and verified by the Zymbit Secure Compute Module (SCM) during the boot process. The Manifest resides within the SCM itself. It does not live on any file system. Zymbit provides an API interface to add/update/delete entries in the Manifest as well as set the action to take if a signature verification of a file should fail.\nAll files in the Manifest must reside within the /boot partition. File paths in the Manifest all include /boot/ by default. Only include the portion of the file path after /boot/. For instance, to include /boot/config.txt, you would call our API with the string config.txt.\nIf any file exists in the Manifest, Supervised Boot is automatically enabled. To turn off Supervised Boot, remove all files from the Manifest.\nExample Python CLI Application Prerequisites Zymbit Modules that support this feature:\nSecure Compute Module (SCM ) All code snippets written in this article are written using Python3.

It can also update all the files in the Manifest or delete all the files in the Manifest. Save the code below to a file. We will name it manifest.py for the following examples.\n#!/usr/bin/python3 import argparse import zymkey def add_update(filepath, slot=None): if slot: print(f\"Manifest Add/Update {filepath} slot={slot}\") zymkey.client.add_or_update_supervised_boot_file(filepath, int(slot)) else: print(f\"Manifest Add/Update {filepath} default slot=15\") zymkey.client.add_or_update_supervised_boot_file(filepath) def update_all_entries(slot=None): list = zymkey.client.get_supervised_boot_file_manifest() if len(list) == 0: print(\"Manifest is empty\") else: for filepath in list.split(): add_update(filepath, slot) def delete(filepath): print(f\"Manifest Delete: {filepath}\") zymkey.client.remove_supervised_boot_file(filepath) def delete_all_entries(): list = zymkey.client.get_supervised_boot_file_manifest() if len(list) == 0: print(\"Manifest is empty\") else: for filepath in list.split(): delete(filepath) def show(): print(\"\\nManifest:\") print(\"---------\") list = zymkey.client.get_supervised_boot_file_manifest() if len(list) == 0: print(\"Manifest is empty\") else: for filepath in list.split(): print(filepath) print(\"\") if __name__ == \"__main__\": # Setup arg parser parser = argparse.ArgumentParser( description=\"add/del/update Supervised Boot Manifest.

The default Manifest as shipped contains:\n$ ./manifest.py Manifest: --------- bcm2711-rpi-cm4.dtb bootcode.bin cmdline.txt config.txt initrd.img kernel8.img start4.elf zymbit_mac_address overlays/vc4-kms-v3d.dtbo To add a file to the Manifest, run the example script with the --add option and give it a filepath to a file in /boot. We’ll create a sample file by copying /etc/hosts,\n$ sudo cp /etc/hosts /boot/sample.txt $ ./manifest.py --add sample.txt Manifest: --------- bcm2711-rpi-cm4.dtb bootcode.bin cmdline.txt config.txt initrd.img kernel8.img start4.elf zymbit_mac_address overlays/vc4-kms-v3d.dtbo sample.txt The SCM will create a signature for the file sample.txt and store it internally. The SCM will verify that signature against the file upon the next boot. If the signature does not verify, the SCM will be held in reset and will not boot. In Development Mode (no bind lock), the SCM will “simulate” this process by flashing an LED sequence of 4 followed by 2 flashes, repeated three times, and then the SCM will boot normally.\nYou can test this out:\nFirst, after adding sample.txt to the Manifest and power cycle. The system should boot normally. Next, edit /boot/sample.txt and power cycle. The sign/verify process will fail and the SCM will simulate a Held in Reset condition with a sequence of 4 flashes followed by 2 flashes, three times. If left in Development Mode (no bind lock), the SCM will boot up and allow you to recover. There are three ways you can remedy the verification failure:\nEdit /boot/sample.txt and revert back to its original contents. Update the Manifest to sync up the current contents of the file with the Manifest ./manifest.py --update sample.txt Remove the file from the Manifest with `./manifest.py –delete ./manifest.py --delete sample.txt The next powercycle should boot with the normal sequence - it should not flash the 4 flashes followed by 2 flashes, three times sequence.\nSpecifying a Different Slot The example above uses the default slot 15 but will take alternative slot numbers, 0-15. Slots in the key store (Slots 16-528) are not supported.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Updated: 2023-01-22\nWhat is Supervised Boot?

Below is a simple code snippet to show how to verify the signature of data using Zymbit’s Python API.\n#!/usr/bin/python3 import zymkey # sign data data = 'hello world!' payload_sig = zymkey.client.sign(data) # verify signature matches encrypted data try: if zymkey.client.verify(data, payload_sig): print('Signature signed correctly by Zymbit module and matches payload.') except Exception as e: print('Signature invalid. Data not signed by Zymbit module private key.') Since the IoT environment is all about communication among many devices, we will demonstrate how to verify a Zymbit module’s ECDSA signature on other devices. We will do this using the public key corresponding to the device’s private key stored securely on the Zymbit module.\nAfter showing how to do signature verification, we will demonstrate how this can be used in a practical situation by collecting temperature data from a sensor and signing the data. We will then package the data in JSON format - a standard format for data communication over the internet using strings. This data will then be published to AWS IoT, where it will be routed via a Rule to a Lambda Function. The Lambda Function will validate the data based on the public key. From there you can route the data to any service you desire.\nThis post will demonstrate how to validate the signatures of all data sent to AWS before processing by another service. All data published to AWS will be authenticated against a device certificate which validates against the Zymbit module’s private key without exporting said key. We will do this by making HTTPS requests to AWS IoT using PyCurl. This serves as client authentication when connecting to AWS IoT. All these examples will be done via Python using the Python-ECDSA library.\nPrerequisites Follow the Getting Started guide first, installing all Zymbit Driver Package. If you wish to try Signature validation on AWS, you need a valid device certificate attached to your AWS account. The device certificate needs to have a policy attached giving it permission to publish data. Simple Signature Validation against Zymkey Public Key Installing Python-Ecdsa library For the verification of ECDSA-NIST256 signatures, we will be using the Python-ECDSA library. Using Pip, the library can be installed simply by running the following command:\nsudo pip3 install ecdsa Simple Signature Verification with Public Key Below is a simple Python program demonstrating how to verify a Zymbit module signature with a public key hosted on a device bound to that Zymbit module. The data passed to the ECDSA verifying function is in bytearray format. The function is validating against the default signing hash function Zymbit module uses, sha256, and returns a boolean indicating whether the signature matches the public key and data. The public key for Zymkey is exported as bytearray using the API function get_public_key().\n#!/usr/bin/python3 import zymkey import ecdsa import hashlib # Function to verify ECDSA signatures, all arguments must be in bytearray format. # Validating against Zymkey signing's default hashing function, sha256 but this can be modified. def verify_ecdsa_signature(data, sig, pub_key): vk = ecdsa.VerifyingKey.from_string(pub_key, ecdsa.NIST256p) return vk.verify(sig, data, hashfunc=hashlib.sha256) if __name__ == \"__main__\": # exporting Zymkey public key as bytearray pub_key = zymkey.client.get_public_key(slot=0, foreign=False) data = 'hello world!' data_bytes = bytearray(data, 'utf-8') payload_sig = zymkey.client.sign(data) if verify_ecdsa_signature(data=data_bytes, sig=payload_sig, pub_key = pub_key): print('Signature matches data and public key pair.') else: print('Signature is invalid; it does not correspond to the public key.') Signature Verification on Another Device This next section will simulate signature verification on another device that receives data in JSON format that has been signed with a Zymbit module. The public key is hard coded into the program for the sake of a simple demonstration, but public key exchange between devices is up to the discretion of the user.\nThe data payload and signature is passed in a JSON string in the format of a hex string. Hex strings are simply representations of the underlying bytes in a human readable format. The JSON data is represented below as the variable received_payload. For this example, we are using received_payload data generated with the following example code on your device with the Zymbit module.\nExport Public Key and Generate Example JSON Data for Validation\n#!/usr/bin/python3 import json import zymkey if __name__ == \"__main__\": # Get public key to give to remote pub_key = zymkey.client.get_public_key() print(\"Public key:\") print(pub_key.hex()) # Create data then sign data data = 'hello world' data_bytes = bytearray(data, 'utf-8') signature = zymkey.client.sign(data) # Store data in a python dictionary that represents JSON. Data is originally in bytearray form # but will be converted to hex_string json_dictionary = { 'data': data_bytes.hex(), 'signature': signature.hex() } # Convert python dictionary to JSON string format received_payload = json.dumps(json_dictionary) print(\"\\nJSON string:\") print(received_payload) Python Code to Verify Signature with Data Generated above Either substitute in your pub_key and JSON data from the previous example or use as is.\n#!/usr/bin/python3 import json import zymkey import hashlib import ecdsa def verify_ecdsa_signature(data, sig, pub_key): vk = ecdsa.VerifyingKey.from_string(pub_key, ecdsa.NIST256p) return vk.verify(sig, data, hashfunc=hashlib.sha256) if __name__ == \"__main__\": # Zymkey public key in hex string format.

Validation of Sensor Data Signature on AWS This example will generate randomly simulated temperature sensor data, package the data into JSON format, and sign and send to send to AWS IoT. The function read_temp() will return an array containing random values for temp_c and temp_f.\nNotice If you wish to use an actual DS18B20 OneWire probe to collect temperature data, you can follow the instructions at this link.\nResources Using a DS18B20 OneWire Probe to Collect Temperature Data View resource Add this code and substitute for the read_temp() function in the example below. This code collects Temperature data from the probe. It reads from a file that the probes deposit temperature data to. The function read_temp() will return an array containing temp_c and temp_f, whenever you need to read temperature from the probes. Substitute this next snippet of code if you are using a real probe.\n#!/usr/bin/python3 os.system('modprobe w1-gpio') os.system('modprobe w1-therm') base_dir = '/sys/bus/w1/devices/' device_folder = glob.glob(base_dir + '28*')[0] device_file = device_folder + '/w1_slave' def read_temp(): # Supplies random temperature in Celsius and Farenheit for this example. lines = read_temp_raw() while lines[0].strip()[-3:] != 'YES': time.sleep(0.2) lines = read_temp_raw() equals_pos = lines[1].find('t=') if equals_pos != -1: temp_string = lines[1][equals_pos+2:] temp_c = float(temp_string) / 1000.0 temp_f = temp_c * 9.0 / 5.0 + 32.0 return temp_c, temp_f Collect data in JSON format, sign, and prepare for AWS\n#!/usr/bin/python3 import json import random import time import zymkey ''' Note that JSON data needs to be in this format: \"{ 'data': 'hex_string of data', 'signature': 'hex_string of signature; }\" If you wish to use a different JSON format, you can always modify the lambda function. ''' def read_temp(): # this provides simulated random data for the example temp_c = float(random.randint(0,100)) temp_f = temp_c * 9.0 / 5.0 + 32.0 return temp_c, temp_f while True: temp_C, temp_F = read_temp() deviceID = 1 myIP= '192.168.100.100' # Package the data in Python dictionary, then convert to JSON string. data = {'temp_F': temp_F, 'temp_C': temp_C, 'deviceIP': myIP, 'deviceID': deviceID} # sign the JSON string json_str = json.dumps(data) json_str_bytes = bytearray(json_str, 'utf-8') signature = zymkey.client.sign(json_str) # Make a new dictionary to hold the hex_strings of the data and signature, and then turn into JSON json_data = json.dumps({'data': json_str_bytes.hex(), 'signature': signature.hex()}) print(json_data) # 10 seconds before reading temperature again time.sleep(10) Sending Encrypted Temperature Data to AWS The AWS SDK doesn’t support TLS connections over OpenSSL engines. Therefore, since we keep the private key in the Zymbit module and not the file system, we will use CURL to make HTTPS requests to AWS with the Zymbit module’s embedded private key. We will be using PyCurl to do this programatically.\nInstalling PyCurl\nPyCurl is simply a wrapper on the libssl library for C/C++. Install and configure libssl library along with PyCurl:\nsudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev sudo apt-get install libssl-dev sudo pip install pycurl Registering Zymbit module device Certificate\nConnecting to and Publishing data to AWS IoT requries you to present a valid certificate that has been regsitered with your AWS account. Instructions for that process is outlined here. Make sure that the certificate has a policy attached to allow data publication on AWS, if you follow the post completely this should be done.\nPublishing data to AWS IoT\nNext we will publish the temperature data signed and saved from the last section to AWS IoT using PyCurl. Make sure to find and change your AWS IoT endpoint in the following code. Information on how to do this can be found in the tutorial linked above.\n#!/usr/bin/python3 import json import pycurl import random import time import zymkey def read_temp(): temp_c = float(random.randint(0,100)) temp_f = temp_c * 9.0 / 5.0 + 32.0 return temp_c, temp_f def ZK_AWS_Publish(url, post_field, CA_Path, Cert_Path,): c = pycurl.Curl() # Set Curl to use zymkey_ssl engine c.setopt(c.SSLENGINE, \"zymkey_ssl\") c.setopt(c.SSLVERSION, c.SSLVERSION_TLSv1_2) # Set certificates for HTTPS connection c.setopt(c.SSLCERT, Cert_Path) c.setopt(c.CAINFO, CA_Path) # Set endpoint and HTTPS type, here it is a POST c.setopt(c.URL, url) c.setopt(c.POSTFIELDS, post_field) # Tell Curl to do client and host authentication c.setopt(c.SSL_VERIFYPEER, 1) c.setopt(c.SSL_VERIFYHOST, 2) # Turn on Verbose output and set key as placeholder, not actually a real file. c.setopt(c.VERBOSE, 1) c.setopt(c.SSLKEYTYPE, \"ENG\") c.setopt(c.SSLKEY, \"nonzymkey.key\") c.perform() c.close() if __name__ == '__main__': while True: temp_C, temp_F = read_temp() deviceID = 1 myIP= '192.168.100.100' # Package the data in Python dictionary, then convert to JSON string. data = {'temp_F': temp_F, 'temp_C': temp_C, 'deviceIP': myIP, 'deviceID': deviceID} # sign the JSON string json_str = json.dumps(data) json_str_bytes = bytearray(json_str, 'utf-8') signature = zymkey.client.sign(json_str) # Make a new dictionary to hold the hex_strings of the data and signature, and then turn into JSON json_data = json.dumps({'data': json_str_bytes.hex(), 'signature': signature.hex()}) # make sure and substitute you AWS endpoint as well as the paths to your certificate AWS_ENDPOINT = 'https://\u003cendpoint\u003e.amazonaws.com:8443/topics/pub_key_validate?qos=1' ZK_AWS_Publish(url=AWS_ENDPOINT, post_field=json_data, CA_Path='/home/pi/verify-sig/AWS_CA.pem', Cert_Path='/home/pi/verify-sig/zymkey.crt') time.sleep(10) Checking Data is being published to AWS IoT If all the previous steps have been done correctly, then you should be able to see the JSON string you published on the AWS IoT console. It will be published to the topic pub_key_validate. This is encoded in the endpoint link you can see in the code. The topic can be changed to whatever you want. Here’s how to check the data from the AWS IoT console:\nFrom the AWS console, select AWS IoT. On the left hand bar, select Test. If MQTT Test is shown choose that. Under subscription topic, write pub_key_validate and hit subscribe. You should see your data being shown as it is being published. Verifying Signature of Encrypted Data with Zymkey Public Key on AWS Signature Verification Lambda function An AWS Lambda function is code that runs on the cloud based on a configured trigger. For this demonstration, the trigger will be data published to a specific topic, pub_key_validate, on AWS IoT. From there the lambda function can validate signatures and talk with any other AWS service.\nThe function is written in terms of a lambda_handler. The event that it gets passed is the JSON string published to AWS IoT. The Python lambda context automatically converts event from a JSON string to Python dictionary.\n#!/usr/bin/python3 import ecdsa import json import hashlib def verify_ecdsa_signature(data, sig, pub_key): vk = ecdsa.VerifyingKey.from_string(pub_key, ecdsa.NIST256p) return vk.verify(sig, data, hashfunc=hashlib.sha256) def lambda_handler(event, context): #event is already converted from json-\u003epython dict pub_key_byte = bytearray.fromhex('9929a80b1d2e1543992dc767f394d1859bc33e9b241203f53473d859e1506f7ee5593b53a7fe7014aecc1f14886e1440e6bde27571c596a7ae3d1573e4122d90') byte_data = bytearray.fromhex(event['data']) byte_signature = bytearray.fromhex(event['signature']) success_message = 'Signature is authenticated against public key and data presented; it is valid.' fail_message = 'Signature authentication has failed.' if verify_ecdsa_signature(data=byte_data, sig=byte_signature, pub_key=pub_key_byte): print(success_message) return success_message else: print(fail_message) return fail_message Setting up Lambda function on AWS\nThe lambda function is the python code that actually validates your Zymbit module signature. The data in JSON format will be published to AWS IoT, and then routed to the lambda function. This is triggered by an IoT rule. This basic lambda function will take the JSON string, validate the data using the Python-ECDSA package, and then print and log its success status.\nTo set up the lambda function on AWS, we must first package the code with the ECDSA package, since it is not part of the Python STL. To do this we zip up the lambda code with the ECDSA package in the build directory.\nPackaging function with Python-ECDSA\nYou can download a pre-configured zip file with Python-ECDSA included here. You can modify the lambda function however you want here, but make sure you change the public key in particular if you want to test out simple validation. If you change the lambda function make sure it is changed inside the zip file.\nOtherwise just zip up the lambda function with the ecdsa directory you made in the build directory. You can do this by first cloning the Github repository. Then build the project by running this build command while inside the project directory.\npython setup.py build Find the ecdsa directory inside the build directory, and zip up that directory with your code.\nNow, follow these steps to upload and activate your code on AWS:\nFrom the AWS Console, select Lambda Select the orange Create function button Choose to Author from Scratch Click next, the trigger will be configured later. Give the Lambda function an appropriate Name and Description. Select Python 2.7 as the Runtime. Under Code entry type, choose to Upload a .ZIP file Upload your Zip file, making sure you have adjusted the public key for the lambda. For Handler make sure to change it to Signature_Validation_Lambda.lambda_handler Choose to Create A Role if you don’t already have one with basic logging privileges. Give it an appropriate name and choose a policy template, picking basicedgelambda. Finally, click next and then create function. Testing Lambda function is working properly\nAWS’ lambda function can be given sample JSON input to test the function. So what we can do is create data and sign it with Zymkey then convert it to a hex string locally, and then copy these strings as input into the lambda function. If the public key in the lambda function you set up is the complement to your Zymkey, it will validate correctly. Here we will use python to print out the JSON string we need.\n#!/usr/bin/python3 import zymkey import json data = bytearray('hello world~') signature = zymkey.client.sign(data) python_dictionary = {'data': data, 'signature': signature} print(json.dumps(python_dictionary)) Copy the output string, you will need to paste it onto the AWS test inputs. From the AWS Lambda console, select your lambda function and click Test. Paste your JSON string as the input. It should return and print a success message.\nCreating AWS IoT Rule\nThe final step is to create a trigger for the Lambda function. Here we will make a Rule in AWS IoT, so that all data published to pub_key_readings are routed to and trigger your Lambda function.\nFrom your AWS Console, click on the AWS IoT service. On the left hand side, select Rules and then click the blue Create button. Give it an appropriate Name and Description. Using SQL version 2016-03-23 use the following settings: Attribute: * Topic Filter: pub_key_reading Set it to trigger a lambda function, and select the lambda function you created for signature validation.\nSeeing it all in Action\nThe whole data pipeline goes like this:\npython collects data -\u003e zymkey signs data -\u003e python packages data to json -\u003e pycurl publish data to AWS IoT -\u003e AWS IoT rule routs data and triggers lambda -\u003e Lambda validates signature and logs the success/failure.\nIf you’ve tested that data is being published and the lambda function is working properly, it should all work when you run the program to publish data.\nFrom your AWS Console, select CloudWatch. Under Logs you shoud see something like /aws/lambda/Signature_Validation. Check the logs for proper validation, if you have no logs chances are your AWS IoT rule is not routing the data properly. If data is being published and no logs appear, check your rule is configured properly.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Introduction While all Zymbit modules make it trivial to verify data …","ref":"/tutorials/aws-iot/verify-sigs/","tags":"","title":"How to Verify Signatures against Public Key on AWS and Other Devices"},{"body":"How to generate a client certificate for your Zymkey, register your own CA, and establish a TLS connection to AWS IoT to publish data. Overview The following post will show you how to create and register a Zymkey Client Certificate for devices connecting to AWS IoT, as well as how to publish data to AWS IoT using Zymkey. This will allow you to connect a client device to AWS IoT using the private key stored in a Zymkey hardware security module, which is inherently a more secure client certification and authentication method.\nIf you have a large number of client devices to connect to AWS IoT, consider using the more automated Just In Time Registration Process using Zymkey. More details.\nAWS IoT uses a certificate based system for its TLS client authentication. This means that any attempted connection to the AWS IoT servers such as when pulling/publishing data, which is done through TLS/HTTPS, requires the client to present a valid client certificate as well as a valid certificate authority certificate. Furthermore the client must be able to prove that they have the private key associated with the provided certificate. Client Certificates are considered valid if they are registered with Amazon.\nIn this example we will be using AWS IoT’s BYOC (Bring Your Own Certicate) system to create a certificate based on Zymkey’s private key and register it with Amazon. The Zymkey certificate can be signed by either the AWS IoT root certificate authority or your own certificate authority. Both methods will be covered here. Once the setup is complete, you will be able to work with AWS IoT using their REST API, authenticating with Zymkey’s private key.\nClassic client TLS authentication requires the user to keep their private key stored in a file, such as in a file called zymkey.key, and the key is read by whatever client is establishing the TLS connection so that it can be used to prove that you own the key.\nWith Zymkey, authentication is done by a key that cannot be read/exported and that isn’t kept on the file system. The key is always stored in the Zymkey hardware.\nLastly, we will show you how to test your setup. This is done with CURL to make HTTPS requests to the MQTT port 8443.\nPrerequisites Notice The following procedure was done with Raspberry PI OS Buster 32bit. The current version of cURL included in bullseye (7.74.0) seems to have an issue using the openssl engine import feature. Install the necessary software packages and insure the Zymkey is bound to its host using the Getting Started Guide.\nHave a registered AWS Account, a free developer account can be made here.\nProcess Overview Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) with Zymkey private key Sign CSR with a Certificate Authority to get a Zymkey Device Certificate If using your own Certificate Authority, register it with AWS Register the Zymkey Device Certificate with AWS Test a TLS connection using your Zymkey Device Certificate and Private Key Attach a policy to the Zymkey Device Certificate to allow it to publish data to AWS IoT Publish data to AWS IoT over TLS using Zymkey Device Certificate for authentication Manual vs. Programmatic Setup Details All AWS settings can be configured either manually through the AWS web interface or programatically through AWS’ boto 3 module in Python. If you would like to use scripts to programatically set up your client certificate, you will need to do the following steps.\nFirst, follow these instructions on the boto3 page to set up the boto3 module for Python: http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/quickstart.html\nThe boto3 module authenticates with AWS based on a IAM Access ID and Secret Key. The boto3 tutorial will ask you to setup an IAM user, here are some instructions on how to do so:\nFrom the AWS console, choose the IAM service. Go to Users and select Add User Choose a username and check the Programmatic access box For simplicity, choose Attach existing policies directly and select AdministratorAccess If you wish to better manage your IAM credentials, feel free to customize your Access Policy. Click Review and then Create User Save the Access ID and Secret Key and follow the boto3 guide. Creating a Certificate Signing Request with Zymkey Bring Your Own device Certificate (BYOC)\nThe first step is to create a valid device certificate using Zymkey’s private key. This can be done by first creating a Certificate Signing Request using OpenSSL:\nopenssl req -key nonzymkey.key -new -out zymkey.csr -engine zymkey_ssl -keyform e -subj \"/C=US/ST=California/L=Santa Barbara/O=Zymbit/OU=Zymkey/CN=rpi.edge.zymbit.com\" The file nonzymkey.key is a placeholder argument and is not actually a real file or used since Zymkey’s private key can not be exported nor read. A CSR file zymkey.csr is created in the directory where this command is run. The -subj argument automatically inserts certificate information, but you can leave this argument out and will be prompted to input your own information. Your CSR now needs to be signed by a valid Certificate Authority.\nRegistering a Certificate Authority Now that you have created a CSR with Zymkey, you have two options for Certificate Authorities.\nOption A - Using the AWS IoT Root Certificate Authority (Easiest) Details Signing CSR with AWS’ Certificate Authority Using AWS’ Certificate Authority is the easier option in terms of setup and allows you to use a trustworthy Certificate Authority that Amazon uses its services. The following steps show you how to sign your Zymkey’s private key with Amazon’s CA and get a valid device certificate:\nManually:\nSign into your AWS console. Here is a link to the console sign-in page: https://aws.amazon.com/console/ From the console, select the AWS IoT Core service Under the secure tab, click on Certificates and click the blue Create a certificate bar Choose the Create with CSR option When the File Selection menu pops up point to your CSR file. It shoud be zymkey.csr by default. Choose Upload file. We created this file on your IoT device, you may need to transfer it to where your logged into AWS. Download the Certificate file on the next screen and save as zymkey.crt. If you are not logged into AWS from your IoT device, transfer the file to your IoT device. We will use this later. You also need to download the root CA for AWS IoT, by clicking Download. On the page that opens, scroll down to the section CA certificates for server authentication, click ECC 256 bit key and click on the adjacent link Amazon Root CA 3. Copy the public key into a file named AWS_CA.pem file. If you are not logged into AWS from your IoT device, transfer AWS_CA.pem to your IoT device. We will use this later. Return to the Create Certificate AWS IoT page and click Activate Programatically: Using the boto3 client, this python script will read the csr file zymkey.csr, give it to AWS to sign with their Certificate Authority, and create a signed certificate zymkey.crt in the directory where this program is run. Furthermore the certificate will be automatically registered and activated with AWS IoT and will be ready for use.\nimport boto3 iot_client = boto3.client('iot') with open('zymkey.csr', 'r') as zymkey_csr_file: zymkey_csr = zymkey_csr_file.read() zymkey_cert = iot_client.create_certificate_from_csr( certificateSigningRequest=zymkey_csr, setAsActive=True ) with open('zymkey.crt', 'w') as zymkey_cert_file: zymkey_cert_file.write(zymkey_cert['certificatePem']) Save the above script into a file called aws_sign_csr.py and run with the following command:\npython aws_sign_csr.py Now that your Certificate has been signed and activated by AWS IoT, it can be used to establish a TLS connection with the AWS IoT servers. Skip down to Testing the TLS Connection section to continue.\nOption B - Using your own Certificate Authority Details AWS IoT also allows you do you use own Certificate Authority as long as you register it with them. This constitutes proving you own the private key to the CA by signing a verification CSR that includes a registration code.\nIf you already have a Certificate Authority that you would like to use, you can ignore the next part. Here we create an example Certificate Authority using OpenSSL.\nCreating an example CA with OpenSSL #!/bin/bash set -e mkdir CA_files cd CA_files openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out zk_ca.key OPENSSL_CONF=/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf openssl req \\ -x509 -new -SHA256 -nodes -key zk_ca.key \\ -days 3650 -out zk_ca.crt \\ -subj \"/C=US/ST=California/L=Santa Barbara/O=Zymkey/CN=zymkey-verify.zymbit.com.dev\" cp zk_ca.crt zk_ca.pem Copy the above lines into a script called mk_ca.sh. You can then run the script in the command line by being in the same directory with the following command:\nbash mk_ca.sh The script will create a directory called CA_files and a couple of files: zk_ca.key: Private key for the created CA, will be supplied to OpenSSL for signing CSRs. zk_ca.pem: PEM formatted certificate for the CA zk_ca.crt: Same file as zk_ca.pem\nSigning CSR with Certificate Authority Next we will be signing the Zymkey CSR with your chosen Certificate Authority.\n#!/bin/bash set -e SCRIPT_NAME=$(basename $0) [ -z $2 ] \u0026\u0026 echo \"${SCRIPT_NAME} \u003ccsr filename\u003e \u003ccrt filename\u003e\" 1\u003e\u00262 \u0026\u0026 exit 1 csr=$1 crt=$2 openssl x509 -req -SHA256 -days 3650 \\ -CA CA_files/zk_ca.crt -CAkey CA_files/zk_ca.key -CAcreateserial \\ -in ${csr} -out ${crt} Copy the above lines into a script called sign_csr.sh. The first argument is the relative or absolute path of your csr file, such as zymkey.csr. The second argument is what you want to name the certificate file of the signed cert. Change the -CA and -CAkey file path, can be relative or absolute, if you are using your own CA. You can then run the script in the command line by being in the same directory with the following command:\nbash sign_csr.sh zymkey.csr zymkey.crt Registering Your Certificate Authority with AWS You now have a valid certificate, zymkey.crt signed by the Certificate Authority of your choice. If you are using your own Certificate Authority, you have to register your Certificate Authority with Amazon’s IoT service so that AWS IoT will accept certificates signed by that Certificate Authority.\nManually:\nFrom the AWS IoT console select Secure, then click CAs and then click Register Click Register CA Follow Steps 1 through 3 on the next screen to create a verification certificate. When signing the verification certificate with your CA in Step 4 run the following command: openssl x509 -req -in verificationCert.csr -CA CA_files/zk_ca.pem -CAkey CA_files/zk_ca.key -CAcreateserial -out verificationCert.crt -days 500 -sha256 Note that if you use a different CA and not the demo one we generated, change the **-CA** and **-CAkey** paths appropriately. Step 5: click Select CA certificate and point to the correct .pem file. If you use the OpenSSL generated SSL point to CA_files/zk_ca.pem Step 6: click Select verification certificate and point to verificationCert.crt which was created in Step 4. Select Activate CA certificate and Enable auto-registration of device certificates Click Register CA certificate button. Programatically:\nThe following python script will automatically create a verification cert with a registration code and automatically activate your Certificate Authority. While it may look a bit intimidating, all you have to worry about is the very last line, where you can change to point to your CA files.\nimport OpenSSL import boto3 import os def gen_AWS_verification_csr(registrationCode): key = OpenSSL.crypto.PKey() key.generate_key(OpenSSL.crypto.TYPE_RSA, 2048) req = OpenSSL.crypto.X509Req() req.get_subject().CN = registrationCode req.set_pubkey(key) req.sign(key, \"sha256\") return OpenSSL.crypto.dump_certificate_request(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, req) def sign_CSR_with_CA(verification_csr, CA_cert_path, CA_key_path): ca_cert = OpenSSL.crypto.load_certificate(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, open(CA_cert_path).read()) ca_key = OpenSSL.crypto.load_privatekey(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, open(CA_key_path).read()) req = OpenSSL.crypto.load_certificate_request(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, verification_csr) cert = OpenSSL.crypto.X509() cert.set_subject(req.get_subject()) cert.set_serial_number(1) cert.gmtime_adj_notBefore(0) cert.gmtime_adj_notAfter(24 * 60 * 60) cert.set_issuer(ca_cert.get_subject()) cert.set_pubkey(req.get_pubkey()) cert.sign(ca_key, \"sha256\") return OpenSSL.crypto.dump_certificate(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, cert) def register_CA_AWS(CA_cert_path, CA_key_path): client = boto3.client('iot') response = client.get_registration_code() registration_key = response['registrationCode'] verification_pem = gen_AWS_verification_csr(registrationCode=registration_key) verification_cert = sign_CSR_with_CA(verification_csr=verification_pem, CA_cert_path=CA_cert_path, CA_key_path=CA_key_path) response = client.register_ca_certificate( caCertificate=open(CA_cert_path).read(), verificationCertificate=verification_cert, setAsActive=True, allowAutoRegistration=True ) return response register_CA_AWS(CA_cert_path='CA_files/zk_ca.crt', CA_key_path='CA_files/zk_ca.key') Copy the above lines into a file called activate_aws_ca.py and run with the following command:\npython activate_aws_ca.py Registering a Device Certificate signed by Certificate Authority Now that your Certificate Authority has been registered with AWS IoT, all that is left to do is to register and activate your Zymbit device certificate.\nDetails Manually:\nFrom the AWS IoT Console click Secure, then Certificates and then click the blue Create button Under Use My Certificate click the Get Started button If you registered your own CA, choose the CA you registered on the Select a CA screen, then click Next Click Select certificates and navigate to the certificate that was signed by your CA. Its default name is zymkey.crt Make sure to check the Activate all circle on the certificate box, and finally click the blue Register certificates button. Programatically:\nThe same thing can be done in Python. Just change the last line to point to your CA_Path and Cert_Path, the paths can be either relative or absolute. For example if the two certificate files: zk_ca.crt and zymkey.crt are in the same directory as the Python script, you don’t have to change anything from the following:\nimport boto3 import OpenSSL def activate_cert_AWS(CA_path, Cert_path): boto3client = boto3.client('iot') with open(CA_path) as CA_file: CA_Pem = CA_file.read() with open(Cert_path) as Cert_file: Cert_Pem = Cert_file.read() return boto3client.register_certificate( certificatePem=Cert_Pem, caCertificatePem=CA_Pem, setAsActive=True, ) activate_cert_AWS(CA_path='CA_files/zk_ca.crt', Cert_path='zymkey.crt') Copy the above lines into a file called activate_aws_cert.py and run with the following command: Change the CA_Path and Cert_path if necessary.\npython activate_aws_cert.py Testing TLS connection with Zymkey Device Certificate: You can now test that your certificate zymkey.crt has been registered correctly by testing a TLS connection with your AWS IoT endpoint. We will be doing this with CURL.\nDetails The first thing to do is to look for your AWS endpoint:\nFrom the AWS IoT console screen, click on Settings in the left hand bar.\nIn the Device data endpoint section, copy the Endpoint.\nReplace endpoint.iot.region.amazonaws.com with the Endpoint you just copied in the following command. Now run the command, making sure to do it in the same directory where you keep your signed certificate, zymkey.crt and your CA cert/pem file, AWS_CA.pem, or CA_files/zk_ca.pem:\n#replace endpoint iot region with the copied endpoint ```bash curl --tlsv1.2 --cacert AWS_CA.pem --cert zymkey.crt --key nonzymkey.key --engine zymkey_ssl --key-type ENG -v -X POST -d \"{ \\\"hello\\\": \\\"world\\\"}\" \"https://endpoint.iot.region.amazonaws.com:8443/topics/hello/world\" ``` Optionally, you can set an environment variable specifying the slot to use. For the HSM6, you will need to specify the variable prior to running the curl command:\nexport ZK_SSL_SLOT=0 You should see a successful TLS connection, but receive a 403 Forbidden Exception from AWS. This is because the certificate you registered, zymkey.crt doesn’t have the appropriate permissions to publish a message to the topic hello/world. We can fix this by adding a policy and attaching it to the certificate.\nHere’s what the successful TLS connection looks like:\nHere’s the 403 exception you should receive:\nAttaching Policy to Certificate and Publishing to AWS IoT Details Here we will attach a Policy to your Zymkey certificate that allows it to publish data to any topic on AWS IoT.\nFrom the AWS IoT console click on Secure and then Policies. Click the blue Create a policy button.\nGive your Policy an appropriate name.\nUnder Action, write the following:\niot:Connect, iot:Publish For Resource ARN write:\n* Check the Allow box, and click Create\nNow, click the Certificates tab on the left and click on the … option on the top right corner of your certificate. Select Attach Policy\nAttach the appropriate policy and you are done.\nPublishing data to AWS IoT Details Now the previous command should work and {“hello”: “world”} should be published to the hello/world topic on your AWS IoT endpoint.\nOn the AWS IoT console and the left hand bar, click on the Test option, and then the MQTT test client option.\nIn the Subscribe to a topic tab, in the Subscription topic box, type in hello/world. Click the Subscribe button\nTest your TLS connection with the following CURL command pointing to the CA cert/pem file and your Zymkey certificate:\n#replace endpoint.iot.region with the appropriate values curl --tlsv1.2 --cacert CA_files/zk_ca.pem --cert zymkey.crt --key nonzymkey.key --engine zymkey_ssl --key-type ENG -v -X POST -d \"{ \\\"hello\\\": \\\"world\\\"}\" \"https://endpoint.iot.region.amazonaws.com:8443/topics/hello/world\" If it works, your command line should have indication of successful TLS connection and “hello”: “world” should show up in your subscribed topic.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"How to generate a client certificate for your Zymkey, register your …","ref":"/tutorials/aws-iot/tls/","tags":"","title":"AWS IoT - TLS Client Certificate Authentication"},{"body":" Bootware File Structure Overview: Brief description of Bootware files that complete the Bootware process.\nLocation: /boot Critical Files: Filename: config.txt\nDescription: RPi Configuration File\nCritical Lines:\ndtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=host kernel=u-boot.bin enable_uart=1 Filename: u-boot.bin\nDescription: U-Boot Bootloader\nFunctions: Loads and executes boot script\nFilename: boot.scr\nDescription: U-Boot Boot Script\nFunctions:\nGenerates U-Boot Environment Updates U-Boot Environment Loads and Boots Kernel Filename: zboot.enc\nDescription: zboot (Bootware zboot Module)\nFunctions:\nInitialize Bootware Perform Update Perform Rollback Perform Recovery Filename: zb_config.enc\nDescription: zboot Configuration File - Generated by zb-wizard\nFilename: uboot.env\nDescription: u-Boot Environment\nFilename: kernel8.enc\nDescription: Bullseye 64 (Encrypted Kernel) - Generated by zboot\nNon-Critical Files: Filename: zboot.log\nDescription: zboot Log File\nzbconfig zb-wizard internally uses the zbconfig tool to configure the device environment.

There are many reasons to encrypt the Root File System (RFS), from keeping WiFi credentials immutable to keeping proprietary software and sensitive data from being cloned.\nFor most Raspberry Pi configurations, only two partitions exist:\n/boot on /dev/mmcblk0p1 / on /dev/mmcblk0p2 INTRODUCING LUKS LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) is the popular key management setup for dm-crypt, the de-facto standard for block device encryption with Linux.\nLUKS provides a robust and flexible mechanism for multiple users (and services) to interface to and access Linux’s ‘dm-crypt’ infrastructure.\ndm-crypt is a transparent disk encryption subsystem in Linux kernel versions 2.6 and later and is part of the device mapper infrastructure, and uses cryptographic routines from the kernel’s Crypto API. Both are widely used and understood in the IT community.\nWeaknesses of single Master key dm-crypt has a single Master Key that is used to encrypt / decrypt data in/out of the block. To ensure long term security and deal with changing authorized users/services, it would be necessary to change the Master Key frequently, and potentially share it with multiple users/services on a regular basis. Every new iteration of Master Key would require the underlying data block to be re-encrypted everytime. In real systems, touched by different users/services, this is impractical.\nHierarchical key management A more practical solution is to have a hierarchical key management setup in which users/services are given User Keys that are used to release the MasterKey. User Keys can be easily changed and revoked, without having to re-encrypt the underlying data block. The management of such a hirearchical key managers is the role of LUKS.\nIn this post we show how to use Zymbit Security Module to lock a User Key, that is subsequently used to unlock the Master Key and provide access to the Root File System. If you’d like to learn more about LUKS see the References at the bottom of this post.\nSECURE STORAGE OF LUKS USER KEYS The security efficacy of your LUKS encrypted RFS is highly dependent upon how the User Keys are generated and where they are stored.\nThe SD Card is NOT a secure storage location The growing single board computer family is awesome, and we love it! It is inexpensive, has an incredible amount of computing power for an embedded device and has a very robust software development ecosystem.\nHowever, these devices have an Achilles heel: the SD card is the primary software deployment media, and it can be very easily removed and manipulated.\nThe natural inclination would be to encrypt the file system using LUKS on dm-crypt, but for unattended use across many deployed units the obvious question is: where is the LUKS key stored? Of course, it’s the file system. Even if you try to obfuscate it through various programmatic means, the key is still very vulnerable to attack.\nSecuring LUKS User Key with Zymbit Security Module. The Zymbit Security Module provides a general “locking” service whereby a block of plaintext data is encrypted and signed.\nWhen used with LUKS, the User Key is sent to the Zymbit Security Module to be locked (encrypted and signed) when the file system is created. When the system boots and needs to decrypt the root file system, the locked LUKS key is “unlocked” (signature verified and contents decrypted) and presented to dm-crypt. If the key was unlocked successfully, the boot process continues normally. Here is the boot sequence with a LUKS/dm-crypt filesystem where the key is protected by Zymbit Security Module:\nThe kernel initializes initramfs initramfs presents the locked LUKS key to Zymbit Security Module Zymbit Security Module validates the signature and decrypts the key* The decrypted key is presented to LUKS and the root file system is then decrypted *requires that Zymbit Security Module operational status is “secure”\nZYMKEY4 fitted to Raspberry Pi\nZymbit Security Module Authenticates Host System Before Unlocking LUKS Key\nOne of the key features of Zymbit Security Module is to generate a unique Identity (ID) for the host system, based upon a fingerprint that measures specific system components. This fingerprinting process is used to “bind” together a specific Zymbit Security Module (root of trust, key store, crypto services), a specific host computer and a specific SD card. Once bound, these components form a permanent and immutable ID of the host system.\nEach time the host device boots, and at random intervals thereafter, the Zymbit Security Module rechecks the ID fingerprint. If any of the system components have changed the fingerprint changes and the system is deemed to have been compromised, authentication fails and all security services are shut down.\nUsing this ID / Authentication feature, the Zymbit Security Module can be used to protect LUKS User Keys in unattended applications, where it might be easy to remove and copy SD card content. (The Zymbit Security Module also has other physical security features which are also used to lock/enable security services)\nWHERE TO STORE YOUR LUKS ENCRYPTED RFS LUKS is very versatile and can be applied to both SD Card and external storage media. Lets review the pros and cons of each option:\nWarning When encrypting your rootfs, we highly recommend turning off unattended-upgrades prior to the encryption process. In some cases primarily with Ubuntu, during an update/upgrade after encryption, the update-initramfs process may fail and leave the system unable to boot.\nTo mitigate this issue, remove the service unattended-upgrades:\nsystemctl stop unattended-upgrades\nsystemctl disable unattended-upgrades\napt remove unattended-upgrades -y\nOption 1 - Convert existing SD Card to LUKS Converting the existing root file system on the SD card still requires an external device (e.g. USB flash drive) that is used as a temporary boot root file system: this provide an easier and lower risk means to convert and copy the original contents. The external devices needs to be a little larger than the existing root file system in order to store the old file system.\nPros:\nLess physical space requirements. Much less power required. Cons:\nConversion is more complex and time consuming than migrating to an external drive. Data space constraints. Write cycle constraints. Access speed constraints. Process Steps Run By Script:\nMake a tarball of the original root file system and store it on the external device Copy the original root file system files to the external device to form a temporary file system Boot to the temporary file system. Once booted, the temporary file system will: Create a LUKS key Lock the LUKS key with Zymbit Security Module Create a LUKS volume on the original root partition. Create an ext4 partition on the LUKS volume on the original root partition Untar the root file system tarball into the converted partition Option 2 - Migrate existing SD card to external LUKS storage device. The existing root file system can be migrated to an external LUKS encrypted USB flash, hard drive or SSD.\nPros:\nExternal devices can hold much more data. Migration is easier and quicker than SD card conversion method. Some external devices have much faster data access than SD cards. Some external devices (e.g. HDD) can tolerate many more write cycles than an SD card. Cons:\nFor HDD and SSD and non-compact USB flash devices, there are additional power requirements. Except for compact USB flash devices, physical space requirements also increase. This may be especially important for the Raspberry Pi Zero family. Process Steps Run By Script:\nCreate the LUKS key Lock the LUKS key Create a LUKS volume on an external USB device Create an ext4 partition on the LUKS volume Move the existing root file system to the LUKS volume on the external device Boot to the new root file system and erase the previous root volume HOW TO ENCRYPT BUILDING YOUR LUKS ENCRYPTED RFS Prerequisites Make sure you have the Zymbit Security Module software suite already running and operational as well as bound. Instructions here.\nOption 1 - Convert existing SD Card to LUKS To convert your root file system to LUKS/dm-crypt, you will need to connect an external USB disk (as temporary storage). As mentioned previously, this is necessary because it is not possible to encrypt the partition in place, so the external disk is needed as temporary storage and a temporary root file system while the conversion takes place. The external disk needs to be at least twice as big as the root partition. Next, run the following script:\ncurl -G https://s3.amazonaws.com/zk-sw-repo/mk_encr_sd_rfs.sh | sudo bash\nFor RPi users: This script is parameterized, so if you have special requirements (e.g. root file system lives on /dev/mmcblk0p4), you can invoke it in the following fashion:\ncurl -G https://s3.amazonaws.com/zk-sw-repo/mk_encr_sd_rfs.sh | sudo bash -s -- -x \u003cpath to external storage device (e.g. /dev/sdX\u003e -m \u003csource partition number\u003e\nIn the above invocation with no parameters, the defaults are:\nOriginal root file system located on /dev/mmcblk0p2 Temporary root file system/storage for original root tarball located on /dev/sda Temporary root file system takes up entirety of new device The very first run of this script on a new temporary external USB disk could take a long time. Also, two reboots are required before the script is complete.\nOne thing to note is that, if the external storage device has an ext4 formatted partition with the original root file system partition (e.g. /dev/mmcblk0p2) on it, this script will use what is already on the external storage device to convert the SD card. This cuts down time for converting lots of device root file systems and allows the script to be used in a mass production deployment.\nOn a Pi4 with an attached USB SSD as the external device on a bare Bullseye “full” version, the first run of this script requires 30 minutes or so to complete the first phase. The second phase takes around 10 minutes.\nBased on the above, using the formatted external device to convert subsequent units should only take around 10 minutes.\nOption 2 - Migrate existing SD card to external LUKS storage device. To migrate your root file system to an external USB device, you can run the following script:\ncurl -G https://s3.amazonaws.com/zk-sw-repo/mk_encr_ext_rfs.sh | sudo bash\nThis script is parameterized, so if you have special requirements, you can invoke in the following fashion:\ncurl -G https://s3.amazonaws.com/zk-sw-repo/mk_encr_ext_rfs.sh | sudo bash -s -- -x \u003cpath to external storage device (e.g. /dev/sdX\u003e -p \u003cdestination partition number -s \u003cmax size of new root partition\u003e -m \u003csource partition number\u003e\nIn the above invocation with no parameters, the defaults for RPi are:\nOriginal root file system located on /dev/mmcblk0p2 New root file system located on /dev/sda1 New root file system takes up entirety of new device Please note that the new root file system should be at least a little larger in size than the original root partition\nRunning this script takes around 30-40 minutes.

If you are just getting started with HSM you may want to start by encrypting some data to disk. This would be useful if you are collecting data to be read/analyzed at later time; and you do not want to store your data ‘in the clear’.\nEncrypting data on disk prevents a bad actor from imaging your SD card and gaining access to sensitive data that is being stored in the field. If bad actor were to successfully image the card, data would remain encrypted and locked with your HSM’s private key. If the HSM was also removed, then the bad actor would still not be able to access the data because each specific HSM is bound to a specific host hardware. Moving a specific HSM to another host hardware would fail the binding process and HSM would not perform any crypto functions, including decryption of data blobs.\nEncrypting Data Blobs The process we describe here can also be used more generally to encrypt binary large objects, or ‘data blobs’\nWhat you will need If you have not already setup and bound your HSM please visit the Getting Started page.\nWe will use temperature data from a DS18B20 OneWire probe. We will encrypt the data to disk using the HSM python package, and then decrypt in a different session. For the purpose of this tutorial I will not be going over the circuit setup and one-wire configuration. That is adequately covered here.

The device certificate is stored inside AWS IoT’s service and can be revoked, deactivated or deleted at any time. AWS IoT can also record and index individual IoT Things within a fleet. Each IoT thing will have its own unique certificate verified by AWS, and can be given unique attributes to identify each device along with policies which control the approved actions of each device.\nUsing AWS IoT also allows device data to be used by other AWS cloud services. Once the device is given credentials, other AWS services can be configured to receive data from the device.\nThe IoT device’s AWS credentials are only valid for a period of time. If the credentials expire, when the AWS CLI tries to connect to AWS servers, it will run an installed script to get new credentials.\nDevice Setup There are four devices in the provisioning process:\nThe Provisioning Device with AWS CLI installed (usually your PC) The Certificate Authority The AWS Credentials Provider The IoT Device(s) getting their credentials (with Zymbit security module(s) installed) If wanted, the CA and provisioning device can be on the same device.\nSetup the Provisioning Device The provisioning device can be any device with AWS CLI installed, but we recommend it not be an IoT device you deploy because the provisioning device will have more AWS permissions.\nInstall AWS CLI.

For large scale deployments, AWS provides an automated process called Just-In-Time-Registration. This allows a user to register a Certificate Authority with AWS so that upon a device’s first TLS connection to AWS servers, if the device certificate was signed by this Certificate Authority, the certificate will be quickly activated by a lambda-function and be ready to use.\nPrerequisites: Follow the Getting Started guide first. Programmatic Setup If you would like to use scripts to register your CA and Lambda function, there are a couple more things to set up. We recommend following the manual approach if your only doing this once or twice.\nDetails Follow these instructions to set up the boto3 module for Python:\nThe boto3 module authenticates with AWS based on a IAM Access ID and Secret Key. The boto3 tutorial will ask you to setup an IAM user, here are some instructions on how to do so:\nFrom the AWS console, choose the IAM service. Go to Users and select Add User Choose a username and check the Programmatic access box For simplicity, choose Attach existing policies directly and select AdministratorAccess If you wish to better manage your IAM credentials, feel free to customize your Access Policy. Click Review and then Create User Save the Access ID and Secret Key and follow the boto3 guide. Register Certificate Authority with AWS The following section will show how to generate your own CA using OpenSSL and register it with your AWS account.\nDetails Create CA Copy the lines below into a script called mk_ca.sh.\n#!/bin/bash set -e mkdir CA_files cd CA_files openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out zk_ca.key OPENSSL_CONF=/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf openssl req \\ -x509 -new -SHA256 -nodes -key zk_ca.key \\ -days 3650 -out zk_ca.crt \\ -subj \"/C=US/ST=California/L=Santa Barbara/O=Zymkey/CN=zymkey-verify.zymbit.com.dev\" cp zk_ca.crt zk_ca.pem You can then run the script in the command line by being in the same directory with the following command:\nbash mk_ca.sh The script will create a directory called CA_files and a couple of files: zk_ca.key: Private key for the created CA, will be supplied to OpenSSL for signing CSRs. zk_ca.pem: PEM formatted certificate for the CA zk_ca.crt: Same file as zk_ca.pem\nRegister CA with AWS Manually:\nFrom the AWS IoT console select Secure then CA and then click Register\nClick register CA\nFollow the directions on the following screen to create a verification certificate.\nWhen signing the verification certificate with your CA in Step 4 run the following command:\nopenssl x509 -req -in verificationCert.csr -CA CA_files/zk_ca.pem -CAkey CA_files/zk_ca.key -CAcreateserial -out verificationCert.crt -days 500 -sha256 Note that if you a different CA and not the demo one we generated, to change the -CA and -CAkey paths appropriately.\nClick Select CA certificate and point to the correct .pem file. If you use the OpenSSL generated SSL point to CA_files/zk_ca.pem\nClick Select verification certificate and point to verificationCert.crt which was created in Step 4.\nSelect Active CA certificate and Enable auto-registration of device certificates\nProgramatically: The following python script will automatically create a verification cert with a registration code and automatically active your Certificate Authority. While it may look a bit intimidating, all you have to worry about is the very last line, where you can change to point to your CA files.\nimport OpenSSL import boto3 import os def gen_AWS_verification_csr(registrationCode): key = OpenSSL.crypto.PKey() key.generate_key(OpenSSL.crypto.TYPE_RSA, 2048) req = OpenSSL.crypto.X509Req() req.get_subject().CN = registrationCode req.set_pubkey(key) req.sign(key, \"sha256\") return OpenSSL.crypto.dump_certificate_request(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, req) def sign_CSR_with_CA(verification_csr, CA_cert_path, CA_key_path): ca_cert = OpenSSL.crypto.load_certificate(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, open(CA_cert_path).read()) ca_key = OpenSSL.crypto.load_privatekey(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, open(CA_key_path).read()) req = OpenSSL.crypto.load_certificate_request(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, verification_csr) cert = OpenSSL.crypto.X509() cert.set_subject(req.get_subject()) cert.set_serial_number(1) cert.gmtime_adj_notBefore(0) cert.gmtime_adj_notAfter(24 * 60 * 60) cert.set_issuer(ca_cert.get_subject()) cert.set_pubkey(req.get_pubkey()) cert.sign(ca_key, \"sha256\") return OpenSSL.crypto.dump_certificate(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, cert) def register_CA_AWS(CA_cert_path, CA_key_path): client = boto3.client('iot') response = client.get_registration_code() registration_key = response['registrationCode'] verification_pem = gen_AWS_verification_csr(registrationCode=registration_key) verification_cert = sign_CSR_with_CA(verification_csr=verification_pem, CA_cert_path=CA_cert_path, CA_key_path=CA_key_path) response = client.register_ca_certificate( caCertificate=open(CA_cert_path).read(), verificationCertificate=verification_cert, setAsActive=True, allowAutoRegistration=True ) return response register_CA_AWS(CA_cert_path='CA_files/zk_ca.crt', CA_key_path='CA_files/zk_ca.key') Copy the above lines into a file called activate_aws_ca.py and run with the following command:\npython activate_aws_ca.py Generate Zymkey Certificate The first thing we will do is generate a device certificate using Zymkey’s private key. We will watch as this certificate gets activated on your AWS IoT console automatically on first connect. Make sure that you do not already have a Zymkey certificate registered on your AWS IoT console.\nGenerate a Certificate Signing Request with Zymkey’s private key using the following command:\nopenssl req -key nonzymkey.key -new -out zymkey.csr -engine zymkey_ssl -keyform e -subj \"/C=US/ST=California/L=Santa Barbara/O=Zymbit/OU=Zymkey/CN=rpi.edge.zymbit.com\" Note that the -subj line can be omitted or modified with your own information. If it is omitted, you will be prompted to enter your information on the command line.\nSigning the CSR to get a valid Zymkey certificate:\nNext we’ll sign this CSR with your Certificate Authority. Save the following script in a file called sign_csr.sh. Make sure to change the -CA and -CAkey paths to point to the private key and certificate file for your certificate authority:\n#!/bin/bash set -e SCRIPT_NAME=$(basename $0) [ -z $2 ] \u0026\u0026 echo \"${SCRIPT_NAME} \u003ccsr filename\u003e \u003ccrt filename\u003e\" 1\u003e\u00262 \u0026\u0026 exit 1 csr=$1 crt=$2 openssl x509 -req -SHA256 -days 3650 \\ -CA CA_files/zk_ca.crt -CAkey CA_files/zk_ca.key -CAcreateserial \\ -in ${csr} -out ${crt} Now run the script with the following command, where the first argument is the path to your CSR and the second argument the name you wish to give the signed Zymkey Certificate file.\nbash sign_csr.sh zymkey.csr zymkey.crt Creating the Lambda function Now we need to create and register the lambda function that will activate new certificates on your AWS account. This can be done either manually or programatically in Python. We’ll start with the Manual method as it is simpler and more straightforward.\nDetails Manually:\nFrom your AWS console, sign in here, choose the Lambda service. From the Lambda console, click on the orange Create Function button. Click the Author from Scratch button. Choose an appropriate function name and description. We will be using Node.js 12.x for the runtime environment. Click Create function. Copy the default JITR code from AWS located here into index.js under Function code (If pasting doesn’t work in their IDE, try Shift+Insert). Make sure that you change the region defined in the code to the appropriate value. Now scroll to the top and click the Permissions tab. Under Execution role, click Edit. There should be an existing role listed under Existing role. Click the blue title View the role on the IAM console. This should take you to the IAM console. Click Attach policies Click Create policy, then the JSON tab. Input the following policy { \"Version\":\"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\":[ { \"Effect\":\"Allow\", \"Action\":[ \"logs:CreateLogGroup\", \"logs:CreateLogStream\", \"logs:PutLogEvents\" ], \"Resource\":\"arn:aws:logs:*:*:*\" }, { \"Effect\":\"Allow\", \"Action\":[ \"iot:UpdateCertificate\", \"iot:CreatePolicy\", \"iot:AttachPrincipalPolicy\" ], \"Resource\":\"*\" } ] } Click Review policy. Give the policy an appropriate name (maybe JITR) and click Create policy. On the left hand bar, click Roles. Click on your lambda role name. It should start with the function name you defined in step 4, followed by role, then some random characters. Click Attach policies. Click the box next to the policy we just created in step 14. Click Attach policy. Click the X to the right of the old policy titled AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole, and click Detach. Programatically: The creation of an AWS lambda function through python scripts is a little more intricate than the manual proccess and will need to be divided into numerous parts. The creation of the lambda function will be divided into these steps:\nCreating a new IAM role for the lambda function. Creating a new Policy for this IAM role. Attaching the Policy to the IAM role. Create the lambda function, attaching the IAM role to this function. \u003cdetails=“Details”\u003e\nCreating IAM Role for the Lambda function The first thing we need to do is create an IAM Role. This role gives the Lambda function permission to execute and perform its registration of new certificates.\nCreating this IAM role furthermore requires you to specify 2 things:\nIAM Trust Document: This is a document that details what AWS resources are allowed to assume this IAM role. Below is an example IAM trust document we will use that allows lambda services to assume this JITR role. Save the document in a file called trust_document.txt.\n{ \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"Service\": \"lambda.amazonaws.com\" }, \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\" } ] } Role Policy: This is a document describing what actions an IAM role may take. This policy is created and then attached to whatever role you wish. The following policy will allow the JITR role to create AWS logs as well as register/activate new certificates and attach policies to them. Save the document in a file called policy_document.txt.\n{ \"Version\":\"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\":[ { \"Effect\":\"Allow\", \"Action\":[ \"logs:CreateLogGroup\", \"logs:CreateLogStream\", \"logs:PutLogEvents\" ], \"Resource\":\"arn:aws:logs:*:*:*\" }, { \"Effect\":\"Allow\", \"Action\":[ \"iot:UpdateCertificate\", \"iot:CreatePolicy\", \"iot:AttachPrincipalPolicy\" ], \"Resource\":\"*\" } ] } Finally, this is the python code that will take care of the creation of the IAM role. The first thing it does is create an IAM role with the specified Trust settings. Then it creates an IAM policy with the aforementioned policy settings. Finally it will attach the policy to the role. This role will be used by the JITR lambda. By default it’ll read the two documents trust_document.txt and policy_document.txt from the same directory that the code is executed in. So save the python script in a file called create_jitr_lambda.py in the same directory as these files, or modify the path to these files in the code. They can be either relative or absolute\nimport boto3 iam_client = boto3.client('IAM') with open('trust_document.txt') as trust_role: trust_document = trust_role.read() with open('policy_document.txt') as policy: policy_document = policy.read() # Creating the IAM role with the specified Trust create_role_response = iam_client.create_role( RoleName='jitr_role', AssumeRolePolicyDocument=trust_document, Description='AWS Role given to the JITR lambda' ) # Creating the IAM policy with the specified P create_policy_resopnse = iam_client.create_policy( PolicyName=policy_name, PolicyDocument=policy_document, Description'Policy that allows JITR lambda to execute actions.' ) # Attaching the IAM policy to the IAM role attach_response = iam_client.attach_role_policy( RoleName=role_name, PolicyArn=create_policy_response['Policy']['Arn'] ) After saving the code in a file called create_jitr_lambda.py, you can execute by running the following command:\npython create_jitr_lambda.py Creating Lambda function The lambda function will then be created with the following script. The code for the lambda function will be in a zipped file named jitr_lambda.zip. Download the lambda code here and make sure to modify the region-name in the code to your approrpiate region.\nNext, zip up the code in a file called jitr_lambda.zip and keep it in the same directory as the following python script.\n#Download the zip file with the lambda code and save it in the same directory as this script. with open('jitr_lambda.zip', mode='rb') as file: filecontent = file.read() lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda') create_lambda_response = lambda_client.create_function( FunctionName='jitr-lambda', Runtime='nodejs4.3', #By appending this script unto create_jitr_lambda.py you do not need to find the role_ARN, as it will already be stored in this object. Role=attach_response['Arn'] Handler='index.handler\t', Code={ 'ZipFile': filecontent }, Description='Lambda function for Just-in-time-Registration', ) Note that this script requires the Role ARN for the IAM role you just created. If you append this script to the file create_jitr_lambda.py, it will already be included in the response from attaching the policy to the jitr_role, and you won’t have to do anything.\n#Do not copy and run these lines, this is just showing where the role_ARN was taken from attach_response = iam_client.attach_role_policy( RoleName=role_name, PolicyArn=create_policy_response['Policy']['Arn'] ) role_ARN = attach_response['Arn'] Otherwise, if you don’t wish to append the following script to the create_jitr_lambda.py, here is how you can find the appropriate role_arn:\nFrom your AWS Console choose the IAM service. On the left hand bar, click on Roles Select the role titled jitr_role. Copy the section following Role ARN In the following python script, replace: Role=attach_resopnse[‘Arn’] with Role=the_correct_role_arn Save the script in an appropriate location, and run it.\nCreating the AWS IoT Rule Finally we will be setting up an AWS IoT Rule to forward all requests with an unregistered certificate to the lambda function that will activate the certificate.\nFirst we need our caCertificateID\nUnder Secure click CAs. Click on the CA Certificate you created earlier. Under the CA Certificate ARN, copy the last section of characters possesing your CA Certificate ID. arn:aws:iot:us-east-2:302973482904:cacert/\u003ccaCertificateID\u003e Now to create the rule\nFrom your AWS Console, click on the AWS IoT service. On the left hand side, select Act and then click Rules. Click Create then give an appropriate Name and Description.

Testing JITR with TLS Connection You can now test your JITR setup by doing a TLS connection with your AWS IoT endpoint and presenting your Zymkey device certificate.\nDetails The first thing to do is to look for your AWS endpoint.\nFrom the AWS IoT console screen, click on the gear that says Settings on the left hand bar.\nCopy the link in the Custom Endpoint box.\nNow on the left hand bar, click on the Test option.\nUnder Subscribe and Subscription Topic, type in hello/world.\nTest your TLS connection with the following CURL command pointing to your CA file and your Zymkey certificate:\nUse CURL to test your TLS connection, pointing to your CA file:\ncurl --tlsv1.2 --cacert zk_ca.pem --cert zymkey.crt --key nonzymkey.key --engine zymkey_ssl --key-type ENG -v -X POST -d \"{ \\\"hello\\\": \\\"world\\\"}\" \"https://endpoint.iot.region.amazonaws.com:8443/topics/hello/world\" The TLS connection should go through, and you should see something like this in your command line:\nOn first connection TLS connection, the TLS handshake should finish, but you should receive empty response from server:\nOn second TLS connection, you will see that the certifiacte is registered and you will get a correct response:\nYou can also check under your certifiactes in your AWS IoT console to see that the new certifciacte is indeed registered. Getting a non-empty response indicates that the certificate is indeed registerd on you AWS account. However, even though the certificate is activated, it does not have a valid policy granting it permission to publish data to your AWS IoT account, which results in the forbidden response. Fortunately you can always modify the jitr lambda function to attach an appropriate policy to the certificate upon registration/activation if you wish to do so.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"How to automatically generate a client certificate, register your own …","ref":"/tutorials/aws-iot/jitr/","tags":"","title":"AWS IoT - Just in Time Registration of Client Certificates using Lambda functions"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/tutorials/perimeter-detect/","tags":"","title":"Perimeter Detect"},{"body":"SECURE PROTOKIT FOR Pi COMPUTERS Waterproof, Dustproof, Radio Transparent, Tamper Evident.\nUpgraded Features ProtoKit5 replaces the ProtoKit4.

Fit the perimeter adapter at the same time.\nSequence for Fitting Zymkey4 and Perimeter Adapter\nConfiguring Perimeter Detect Circuits Zymbit security modules contain two perimeter circuits that can be used to detect tampering of a secure envelope. Each tamper circuit is closed in normal operation. When a circuit is opened, a Tamper Event is registered by the Zymbit Security Module.\nLearn how to configure and operate perimeter events in software \u003e\nTypically the two circuits are configured to provide independent layers of physical security:\nPERIM 1 - protects an inner electronic enclosure, like this ProtoKit5 enclosure. PERIM 2 - protects an outer cabinet enclosure, trip wire or other. On ProtoKit 5 there are several ways to configure PERIM 1 and PERIM 2. By default both circuits are closed with two jumpers. 1A\u003c\u003e1B , 2A\u003c\u003e2B.\nUsing Tamper Switches The protoboard includes two tamper switches, PERIM_SWA and PERIM_SWB, that are connected in series to the PERIM 1 tamper circuit. To configure and activate these switches follow these steps:\nRemove the Jumper 1A\u003c\u003e1B Pressing down both switches SWA, SWB will close the PERIM 1 circuit. The lid of you ProtoKit 5 includes two “actuators” that align with the switches and activate (close) them when the lid is fitted and screwed securely in place. If needed you can adjust the length by screwing the actuator in or our of the panel. Tamper Switch Actuators Fitted to Lid Tamper Switch Actuators Pressing Switches Using Perimeter Pads The protoboard includes four tamper pads that are connected to the PERIM 2 tamper circuit as follows:\nConnected on protoboard PCB (orange color) PERIM_PAD_2A \u003c\u003e PERIM_2A_ZYMKEY4 PERIM_PAD_2B \u003c\u003e PERIM_2B_ZYMKEY4 PERIM_PAD_2C \u003c\u003e PERIM_PAD_2D\nConnected by user circuit (green color) PERIM_PAD_2A \u003c\u003e PERIM_PAD_2C PERIM_PAD_2B \u003c\u003e PERIM_PAD_2D\nExamples for Using Perimeter Pads The Perimeter Pads are designed to be used in applications where the lid contains a user defined circuit such as a display or keypad, or this custom shield (which was designed for ProtoKit4). Springed Pogo pins can be used to connect the lid to the perimeter pads. This provides an additional layer of physical security to the tamper-switches.\nAdd Your Pi Computer Fit the GPIO extender header. Fit your Pi computer being careful to correctly align pins.

Additional Resources If you are a developer interested in creating your own custom implementations of Accounts and/or Keyrings to work with ZymbitKeyringManager, we encourage you to explore our Github repository. By extending the Account and Keyring Abstract Base Classes (ABCs), you can implement the required methods and any additional functionality as needed. The elliptic curves we support (secp256k1, secp256r1, and ed25519) are used by many major blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, and Polkadot. Developing your own keyrings can be incredibly beneficial for a wide range of applications, such as key management or on-chain interactions like sending transactions or interacting with smart contracts.\n","categories":"","description":"Zymbit Wallet Python SDK","excerpt":"Zymbit Wallet Python SDK","ref":"/reference/zymbit-wallet-sdk/zymbit-wallet-sdk-py/","tags":"","title":"Zymbit Wallet Python SDK Documentation"}]
