## Overview

Blockchain accounts, signatures, and transactions have an additional layer of complexity over traditional cryptographic keys and signatures. Our Wallet SDK aims to abstract away this complexity, enabling you to create and manage multiple blockchain wallets and seamlessly integrate with various blockchains without having to deal with their technical intricacies.

**NOTE:** Only available on the [HSM6](https://www.zymbit.com/hsm6/), [SCM](https://www.zymbit.com/scm/), and [SEN](https://www.zymbit.com/secure-compute-node/)


## Architecture

The Zymbit Wallet SDK is the package which contains our libraries which support Blockchain account creation, management, and use. The SDK consists of modular components which can work independently or together, depending on your use case, to create a seamless interface between Zymbit's [HD hardware wallet](https://www.zymbit.com/hd-hardware-wallet/) and blockchains. More details can be found in the documentation.
