### Bootware 1.0 

Bootwareâ„¢ is a set of software tools and micro services for the Zymbit Secure Compute Module [(SCM)](https://www.zymbit.com/scm/) based product line, including the Zymbit Secure Edge Node [(SEN)](https://www.zymbit.com/secure-compute-node/). 

To get started with Bootware, you should have an SCM based product (Secure Edge Node or Dev Kit) up and running. The default hostname is zymbit-dev and the default login is zymbit with a password of zymbit. We recommend you change those during your development process.

It is also recommended to have an HDMI console attached when using Bootware. The process of repartitioning and populating partitions can take substantial time, upwards of 45 minutes and the console serves as a point of reference of activity.
