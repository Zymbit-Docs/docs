Welcome to Zymbitâ€™s Documentation Site! Here, you will find all the resources you need to learn about and to use all Zymbit products.

### Recent Activity

#### October 2023
Secure Compute Module moved from Revision A to Revision B. The Zymbit Software was not changed but the partitioning was changed from 100% of the eMMC to 50% of the eMMC. This was done to accommodate future support for Bootware, which is available in a Preview mode. A utility is included to repartition to 100% when running the standard product. See the [Troubleshooting/FAQ](troubleshooting/scm) for more information on the changes from Rev A to Rev B of the SCM itself.

#### September 2023
We recently pushed up a Preview for Bootware. This is for Development purposes and not meant for Production. More details on the Preview can be found here:  [Bootware Preview](bootware-preview)
