Welcome to Zymbitâ€™s Documentation Site! Here, you will find all the resources you need to learn about and to use all Zymbit products.

### NEWS

1/22/2023 - We recently pushed up a new, common code base (RC-23.01) that works for all Zymbit products. This adds support for our Secure Compute Module in the main code repository, as well as support for Bullseye 64-bit and Ubuntu 22.04LTS Jammy, and bug fixes, etc. Details can be found on the [General Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting/general/) page.
