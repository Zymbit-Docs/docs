#### October 2023
-----
Secure Compute Module moved from Revision A to Revision B. The Zymbit Software did not change. The root filesystem partitioning changed from 100% of the eMMC to 50% of the eMMC (encrypted). This was done to accommodate future support for Bootware, which is available in a Preview mode. A utility is included to repartition to 100% (encrypted) if required. 

See the [Troubleshooting/FAQ](troubleshooting/scm) for more information on the changes from Rev A to Rev B of the SCM itself.

oses and not meant for Production. More details on the Preview can be found here:  [Bootware Preview](bootware-preview)
