### Recent Activity

#### October 2023

Raspberry PI foundation recently released support for Debian 12 based OS known as Bookworm. We are currently in the process of building and testing native support for Bookworm. Full support for Bookworm will be provided shortly. 

Secure Compute Module moved from Revision A to Revision B. The Zymbit Software did not change. The root filesystem partitioning changed from 100% of the eMMC to 50% of the eMMC (encrypted). This was done to accommodate future support for Bootware, which is available in a Preview mode. A utility is included to repartition to 100% (encrypted) if required. 

See the [Troubleshooting/FAQ](troubleshooting/scm) for more information on the changes from Rev A to Rev B of the SCM itself.

#### September 2023
We recently pushed up a Preview for Bootware evaluation. This is for Development purposes and not meant for Production. More details on the Preview can be found here:  [Bootware Preview](bootware-preview)
