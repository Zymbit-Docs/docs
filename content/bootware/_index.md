Supercool info on Bootware!

Bootware™ is a set of software tools and micro services for the Zymbit Security Modules. The latest release of Bootware is 1.2. Links to previous versions can be found below.

Bootware 1.2 adds support for all ZYMBIT products including the HSM6 and HSM4. Bootware™ 1.2 adds platform support for Raspberry Pi5. Bootware™ 1.2 brings in an entirely new User Interface consolidated into one executable.

To get started with Bootware, you should have your plaform OS installed and the Zymbit product up and running. For our example images, the default hostname is zymbit-dev and the default login is zymbit with a password of zymbit. We recommend you change those during your development process. 

For any Bootware image, the PI RAM must exceed the size of the compressed zi image. We recommend the PI have at least 4MB RAM.

It is also recommended to have an HDMI console attached when using Bootware. The process of repartitioning and populating partitions can take substantial time, upwards of 45 minutes and the console serves as a point of reference of activity.
