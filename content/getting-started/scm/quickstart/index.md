### **Overview**

The Zymbit Secure Compute Module (SCM) is an all-in-one Linux compute module - secured and ready to deploy into your IoT and edge applications : a Zymbit Security Module + Hardware Wallet + Raspberry Pi CM4 integrated into a secure encapsulated module.

## **Configure and Setup your SCM**

#### Power On, Bootup, and SSH in
 * Connect up the ethernet and 12V power. The unit is designed to run headless. You do not need a monitor, keyboard, or mouse. As shipped, the hostname is `zymbit-dev` and a user named `zymbit` can be used for SSH login. The default password for SSH is zymbit. Please change your password once you login. Console login has been disabled.

{{< callout notice >}}
All necessary Zymbit Driver Package has been pre-installed. No further installation is necessary. The pre-installed image is encrypted and cannot be replaced via `rpiboot` in the field. Please contact support@zymbit.com for assistance.

 * Monitor the Blue LED on the Zymbit SCM module. The total boot time as configured should take approximately 90 seconds from power on. It will go through the following stages:
    - one slow blink:    *initializing the SCM*
    - one -> two -> three -> four blinks:   *Supervised Boot is verifying the signed file information*
    - rapid blinking:   *Supervised Boot successfully completed, booting underway*
    - blinking stops:   *USB bus enumeration found SCM; may stay off for seconds*
    - one blink every 3 seconds:   *zkifc has loaded and the system is ready to go*

#### Pre-loaded OS options
* Raspberry PI OS Lite (64-bit Bookworm)
* Raspberry PI OS Lite (Legacy 64-bit Bullseye)
* Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (64-bit jammy)

{{< callout warning >}}
We highly recommend turning off unattended-upgrades prior to the encryption process. In some cases primarily with Ubuntu, during an update/upgrade after encryption, the update-initramfs process may fail and leave the system unable to boot.

To mitigate this issue, remove the service unattended-upgrades:
```bash
systemctl stop unattended-upgrades
systemctl disable unattended-upgrades
apt remove --purge unattended-upgrades -y
```

#### Recent Changes

* Now allow initial SSH via password (use zymbit/zymbit). Please change once logged in.
* No longer providing SSH key on USB stick; as noted above, you can use password.
* No longer necessary to register product; no SSH key necessary so no need for key passphrase.
* sudo for user zymbit with password in standard PI OS manner allowed; no need to supply password every time.

* FW 01.02.02release - April 2024. Update bootcode.bin to 1/11/2023 version. You can verify with `vcgencmd bootloader_version`. Should say 1/11/2023. Necessary to support Ubuntu 22.04.
* FW 01.02.02release - Supports B1 revision of SCM
* FW 01.00.00 - Supports A1 revision of SCM
* FW 01.00.00 - Fixed:  #117 Stored tamper event on shutdown has incorrect timestamp
* zkifc 1.2-36 - Fixed: #120 get_public_key() with a very large number crashes zkifc
* zkpkcs 11 1.0-3 - Fixed: #123 zk_pkcs11: Doesn't work with 64-bit OS

#### Issue Number #159 - Major
Affects SCM, Firmware version: 01.02.02release (not in earlier firmware releases)

On B1 versions of the SCM with firmware version 01.02.02release, generated key pairs created with `gen_key_pair()` are removed during reboot.

You can determine the version with:

`python3 -c "import zymkey; print(zymkey.client.get_firmware_version())"`

#### Details and Workaround:

`gen_key_pair(key_type)` creates key pairs for slots 16 and up, but a reboot removes the key slots. Keys generated using the BIP32 wallet with `gen_wallet_master_seed()`/`gen_wallet_child_key()` keys are not removed on reboot. The BIP32 wallet keys can be used as a workaround for B1 units.

For example,

Instead of:

`key_slot = gen_key_pair("secp256k1")`

Use:

`seed = zymkey.client.gen_wallet_master_seed("secp256k1", "", "wallet_name")`

`key_slot = zymkey.client.gen_wallet_child_key(seed, 0, False)`

From this point on you can use the `key_slot` in the same manner to `get_public_key(key_slot)` or `remove_key(key_slot)`

#### Notes:

* The problem does not affect the use of slots 0 through 15.
* The problem does not affect public keys stored in the Foreign key store.
* BIP32 wallets are hierarchical key stores, meaning removing the wallet master seed will remove all the keys in that wallet; removing a parent will remove all child slots of the parent. See BIP32 for more information.
* BIP32 wallets can be recovered if you setup a recovery method using either BIP39 mnemonics, or SLIP39 Shamir's Secret Sharing of mnemonics. Zymbit supports both methods.
* Your particular application of keys may lend itself to different key hierarchy strategies - you could put one key in each wallet and create many wallets or put many keys in one wallet. For details on wallets, you can see https://docs.zymbit.com/tutorials/digital-wallet/
* If you are creating multiple wallets, each wallet must have a unique name.
 
This only affects SCMs with firmware 01.02.02release. This does not affect the HSM6.
