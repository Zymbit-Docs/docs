<h3><b>Introduction to Secure Compute Module</b></h3>
</summary>

<br>
Thank you for in our Secure Compute Module (SCM) product line. SCM is a commercial product, designed to bring a higher level of security to applications that use single board computers deployed outside the security of a data center â€“ IoT, gateways, terminals etc. Its purpose is to protect valuable assets like IP, data and credentials from typical real-world exploits. It is designed for developers to innovate freely using familiar tools, without needing expert security knowledge or additional layers of technology.

### **Overview**

The Secure Compute Module is offered as a standalone unit or can be ordered from us with two options of Development Kits, or as a complete, enclosed Node product. We currently offer two flavors of a pre-installed image:

* Raspberry PI OS Lite (Bullseye 64-bit)
* Raspberry PI OS Lite (Bullseye 32-bit)

Refer to [SCM Beta Release Notes](../../../troubleshooting/scm/) for details on this SCM release (rc-23.01)

{{% callout notice %}}
All necessary Zymbit software has been pre-installed. No further installation is necessary. The pre-installed image is encrypted and cannot be replaced via `rpiboot` in the field. Please contact support@zymbit.com for assistance.

* Pre-loaded Linux kernel (bullseye 32-bit)
* Pre-load with customer software
* Pre-defined file manifest & policies
* Custom MAC OUID blocks available
* Embedded hardware wallet with SLIP39-Shamir's Secret Sharing

##### Layers of Security
* Supervised boot
* Fully encapsulated
* Last gasp power defenses
* Tamper sense and response
* File system encryption
* Measured system identity & authentication
* Data encryption & signing

##### Compute Options
* Broadcom BCM2711, Quad core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.5GHz
* LPDDR4 RAM: 1G to 8G, eMMC: 0G to 32G
* 2.4/5.0GHz Wi-Fi & Bluetooth

### **Configure and Setup your SCM**

##### 1) Power On and Bootup
 * Connect up the ethernet and 12V power. The unit is designed to run headless. You do not need a monitor, keyboard, or mouse. As shipped, the hostname is `zymbit-dev` and a user named `zymbit` can be used for SSH login. SSH login is restricted to only use keys.

The total boot time as configured should take approximately 90 seconds from power on.

 * Monitor the Blue LED on the Zymbit SCM module. It will go through the following stages:
    - one slow blink:    *initializing the SCM*
    - one -> two -> three -> four blinks:   *Supervised Boot is verifying the signed file information*
    - rapid blinking:   *Supervised Boot successfully completed, booting underway*
    - blinking stops:   *USB bus enumeration found SCM; may stay off for seconds*
    - one blink every 3 seconds:   *zkifc has loaded and the system is ready to go*

##### 2) Login via SSH with key
The SSH key is included on the USB drive in two formats: PPK for use with Putty and PEM for standard linux ssh
