### **Configure and Setup your SEN D35 Prototype Kit**

##### Power On
 * Connect a 12V Power Supply up to the front panel 12V barrel connector. Connect an ethernet cable to the gigabit ethernet port. The unit is designed to run headless. If you prefer, you do not need a monitor, keyboard, or mouse. Access is via SSH or the monitor.

Monitor the Blue LED on the Zymbit SCM module. The total boot time as configured should take approximately 90 seconds from power on. It will go through the following stages:

- one slow blink:    *initializing the SCM*
- one -> two -> three -> four blinks:   *Supervised Boot is verifying the signed file information*
- rapid blinking:   *Supervised Boot successfully completed, booting underway*
- blinking stops:   *USB bus enumeration found SCM; may stay off for seconds*
- one blink every 3 seconds:   *zkifc has loaded and the system is ready to go*

##### Login via SSH

Once the boot sequence completes and the Blue LED is blinking once every three seconds, login remotely via SSH. As shipped, the hostname is `zymbit-dev` and a user named `zymbit` can be used for SSH login. The default password for SSH is zymbit. Please change your password once you login. Console login has been disabled.

See [Quickstart for SCM](../../scm/quickstart) for more information on how to proceed.
