### **Issues and Solutions**

#### Expired GPG Key Preventing Access to Repository

The Zymbit GPG key expired and was renewed on September 30, 2022. New installations should not have any problems. `apt-get update` may complain that the GPG key has expired. To update your local key, do the following:

```bash
sudo su
curl -L https://zk-sw-repo.s3.amazonaws.com/apt-zymkey-pubkey.gpg | apt-key add -
```


#### CPU Scaling Governor
We have seen some issues with the scaling cpu governor on the raspberry pi interfere with the i2c bus. This sometimes causes the zymkey to be put into a odd state or return failures from operations that get optimized out by the governor. The raspberry pi sets the **scaling governor** to be "**ondemand**" by default. We recommend switching this mode to "**performance**" to get the best out of the zymkey. Details:

How to set cpu governor to performance.

#### Unattended-upgrades
When encrypting your rootfs, we highly recommend turning off unattended-upgrades prior to the encryption process. In some cases primarily with Ubuntu 20.04, during an update/upgrade after encryption, the `update-initramfs` process may fail and leave the system unable to boot.

To mitigate this issue, remove the service unattended-upgrades:

`systemctl stop unattended-upgrades`

`systemctl disable unattended-upgrades`
